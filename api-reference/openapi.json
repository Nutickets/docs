    "description": "\n## Introduction\nWelcome to the interactive documentation for the ticketing, access control, event management & transactional REST API. All available endpoints are listed in the left menu and can be executed directly within the browser, making it easy for developers and non-developers alike to familiarise themselves and interact with the API. Code snippets are available in over 18 different programming languages.\n\n## Getting Started\nInteracting with the API is as simple as 3 easy steps:\n1. First, obtain an api token via the token management UI in Admin.\n2. Then, select an endpoint from the left-hand side and paste the API token into the **Token** field on the far right column, just above the *Send Request* button.\n3. Finally, click **Send Request** and inspect the response shown below to see if your call was successful.\n\n## Asynchronous Requests\n\nThe API supports the ability to process requests asychronously. This may be suitable where you wish to ingest larger volumes of data per request, or anticipate a high throughput of API activity. The steps of making an async request are as follows:\n - Make the request to the endpoint that you wish to process asynchronously as you normally would, but with the addition of a GET param `async=true`.\n - You will receive back a JSON 202 response with an `asyncUuid` unique to your request.\n - To see whether the request has finished processing, a request can be made to the same endpoint again, but this time with `asyncUuid=YOUR_UUID_HERE` as a GET param\n - If the request is still processing, you will receive back a 202 status again and will need to continue polling the same endpoint.\n - If the request has finished processing, you will receive the actual response in the same format as you would a non-async request\n\n> Asynchronous requests are rate-limited the same as synchronous requests, the extent of which will depend on your account configuration. Polling requests do not count towards your rate limit, however you should aim to poll as infrequently as appropriate and adjust accordingly to each use-case.\n\n### Additional Notes\n - You can receive additional validation errors due to making an async request. One important point to note is that you cannot make an async request for any endpoint that requires a password.\n - Your async response will be available for 2 hours after completion, and will be deleted at this point whether it has been retrieved or not.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### How often do I need to obtain an API token?\nYou only need to obtain a token __once per user account__ as the token can be re-used indefinitely. The only time that it's mandatory to obtain a new token is if you have reason to believe that there has been a breach involving your existing token.\n\n#### Does requesting a token invalidate the previous token?\nNo, requesting a new token will not impact any existing tokens.\n\n#### How do I revoke a token?\nTokens can be revoked from the token management interface found in Admin > Settings > API Settings. You may need to request for your token to be revoked if you do not have the required permissions to access this section.\n\n#### Which endpoints do I have access to?\nThe level of access depends entirely on the roles & permissions associated with the account used to generate your API token. If you are an Admin Super User, then you will have access to all endpoints.\n\n#### What data will I be able to access through the API?\nEach endpoint clearly defines the format of the returned data along with sample data. The data will match what you can see in Admin, meaning it will be filtered down based on your permissions and visibility group(s).\n\n#### How does it work with multi-company accounts?\nFor accounts that have access to more than one company, the API will perform actions on behalf of your *last selected company*. You can change this behaviour by specifying a company ID via the `X-NU-COMPANY-ID` header. This header must be passed to every API call to mitigate the risk of making a call on behalf of the wrong company. Alternatively, you could create separate API users for each individual company and issue separate tokens for each user. The latter is recommended when the API calls are made by a third-party as it locks the API token to the relevant company.\n\n#### How does it work with multi-language companies?\nOur API is fully compatible with the multi-language features available throughout the platform. All API requests can make use of the standardised [`Accept-Language`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language) request header to indicate the preferred language for both read and write based requests.\n\n<span class='sl-text-lg sl-font-semibold sl-px-2.5 sl-py-1 sl-bg-warning sl-text-on-primary sl-rounded-lg'>Note</span> when using our API docs to send requests, your browser will automatically include the `Accept-Language` header based on your browsers preferred language settings if you do not define it explicitly.\n\nIf a language is supplied within the request that is not supported by the company, then the company fallback language will be assumed. All responses will include a [`Content-Language`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Language) header which defines which language was _actually_ used to process the request.\n\n#### How are rate limits applied?\nAll companies are subject to rate limits for their API calls. By default this rate limit starts at 60 requests per minute (rolling interval), however may be increased on demand. Prior to increasing any rate limits, integration partners are expected to ensure that adequate caching policies are in place to avoid increasing load on the API servers unnecessarily. When a company exceeds rate limits, future requests will be blocked until your rate limit replenishes. To assist you in ensuring you do not continue to send requests to our servers when you've exceeded your limits we provide a `X-Remaining-Requests` header on responses, indicating the number of requests remaining. We also provide the `X-Available-In-Seconds` header to indicate over what period your rate limit is applied.\n\n#### How are API changes handled\nWe try our best to adhere to a _'no-breaking-changes'_ policy and favour a backward-compatibility approach. We may introduce a new major version of the API from time-to-time if we need to apply structural changes. This would not effect existing integrations as the new version will be exposed through a different URL (i.e. `/v2/events` instead of `/v1/events`). Any changes, major or minor, will be documented in our API changelog.\n\n#### What functionality is available in the API\nThe API tries to mirror as much functionality available through our own interfaces as possible so that developers and third-party vendors have total freedom on how they use & integrate with our platform. Some examples include, but not limited to:\n * **Administritive operations:** such as event management, user management and inventory management.\n * **Ecommerce operations:** such as processing sales, reserving tickets and managing discounts.\n * **Access control operations:** such as admitting attendees, pairing NFC devices and scanning out of zones.\n * **Migration operations:** such as synchronizing data between systems.\n * **Reporting operations:** such as pulling custom reports, aggregating and presenting data in alternative formats.\n\n## Changelog\n\nChanges to the API will be documented below in reverse chronological order. Refer to the official release notes for the wider system updates (and API changes pre-2022).\n\n#### 27th January 2026\n- `GET /resale-listings` and `GET /resale-listing`:\n  - Added new filtering options: `eventId`, `customerId`, `createdAfter`, `createdBefore`, `status`, and `withTrashed`.\n  - Added new attributes to resale listing responses: `eventId`, `orderId`, `createdAt`, `closedAt`, `onSaleFrom`, and `onSaleUntil`.\n  - Added new attributes to resale contract responses: `currencyId`, `price`, `totalPrice`, `displayTotal`, and `soldAt`.\n  - Added ability to include `events`, `orders`, `resaleContracts.replacingOrderItem`, and `resaleContracts.payoutTransaction`.\n- `GET /resale-listings` and `GET /resale-listing`: Added ability to include `resaleContracts.payoutWalletTransaction` to retrieve wallet transaction details for sold resale contracts.\n- Added `bundledItems` (id + quantity) to `GET /sale-items` and `GET /sale-item` when bundle data is present.\n\n#### 20th January 2026\n- Added support for all item types in the `GET /order-items` `type` filter parameter. Previously only `ticket`, `product`, and `guestList` were accepted. Now accepts all 14 item types including `season_ticket`, `fee`, `bundle`, `gift_voucher`, and more. Refer to the endpoint documentation for the full list.\n\n#### 6th January 2026\n- **Breaking:** `GET /wallets` and `GET /wallet` endpoints now return `customerId` instead of `userId` in the response attributes. This is consistent with all other API endpoints that provide customerIds instead of userIds.\n\n#### 22nd December 2025\n- Updated `DELETE /resale-listings` to properly cancel resale listings with validation. Response now includes `contractsCancelled`, `contractsSold`, and `contractsFrozen` counts. Sold and frozen contracts are preserved; only unsold, unfrozen contracts are cancelled.\n\n#### 19th December 2025\n- Added `eventId` as a filter to the `GET /orders` endpoint to retrieve only orders that contain items from the given event ID.\n- Added a new `orderItemId` filter to `GET /v1/wallets/transactions` endpoint.\n- Added a new `source` attribute to the `WalletTransactions` entity from `GET /v1/wallets/transactions` to detail the source of the wallet transaction.\n\n#### 17th December 2025\n- Added new `GET /wallets` and `GET /wallet` endpoints to retrieve wallets registered within a company (NB: wallets power our account balance functionality).\n- Added a new `GET /v1/wallets/transactions` endpoint to list all recent transactions across wallets (or for a specific wallet)\n- Added `POST /v1/wallets/transactions/confirm` to allow confirmation of pending transactions. Pending transactions are typically used for resale, order modifications, and other internal processes that deposit money into wallets.\n- Added `POST /v1/wallets/payouts/initiate` to allow initiation of an external payout from a wallet. Unlike cashouts, payouts are not capped at the mount of topups purchased. This endpoint allows for a full payout of the account balance, regardless of source of funds.\n- Added `POST /v1/wallets/payouts/confirm` to confirm when an initiated payout has been completed. This is an important step where external parties need to also verify that the payout was handled correctly.\n- Removed deprecated endpoints `POST /v1/wallets/nfc-download` and `POST /v1/wallets/nfc-download/confirm` as these are no longer in use or supported.\n- Add `GET /v1/resale/listings` index endpoint to return all available resale listings\n- Payload updats to `POST /v1/resale/listings` to support creation of multiple item listings\n- Added a new `authenticationProviders` relationship that can be included on both `GET /customers` and `GET /customer` to determine the related customer SSO IDs.\n\n#### 3rd December 2025\n- Added a new `orderColumn` attribute to `GET /sale-items` endpoint, which reflects the sort order defined in admin, and used in the ticket shop.\n\n#### 20th November 2025\n- Added a new `DELETE /customers` endpoint to support customer data deletion requests & accommodate data retention policies.\n\n#### 11th November 2025\n- On `GET /events` and `GET /event` we now return the `isCancelled` attribute to indicate that an event has been marked as cancelled.\n\n#### 4th November 2025\n- Added a new `DELETE /customers` endpoint to support customer data deletion requests & accommodate data retention policies.\n- We now return all fees, resale fees, fulfilment fees, and protection fees via the `GET /v1/order-items` endpoint\n- When returning fees via the `GET /v1/order-items` endpoint we also provide access to the `producingOrderItemId` field which allows consumers to reference the order item that generated that specific fee. Where this is `null` the fee applies to the whole basket.\n- Added the ability to retrieve orders from the `GET /v1/order` endpoint using the reference, rather than the ID.\n\n#### 16th October 2025\n- Introduced access control scanning / pairing restrictions to items that belong to an order which is currently being modified, or resold.\n- `GET /v1/entry/tickets` receives a new status (`variable.status`) option `locked`, which indicates that the order is currently being modified. Items with this status should be considered _temporarily_ invalid for scanning. The status of these items could return to `sold` or `refunded` in the future.\n- Added `POST /v1/resale-contracts` to create a resale contract, which allows an order item to be resold\n- Added `GET /v1/resale-contract` to get a resale contract for an order item or by ID\n- Added `POST /v1/resale-contracts/delete` to delete a resale contract for an order item or a resale contract ID\n- Added `replacedOrderItem` to `GET v1/order-items`, `GET v1/order-item` and `GET v1/order` to return the original order item for resold and modified order items.\n\n#### 2nd October 2025\n- Added a new `cancelExistingBasket` parameter to `POST /v1/basket-items` which allows expiring a basket and adding items to a new basket in a single request.\n- Added a new endpoint `DELETE /v1/baskets` for expiring baskets.\n- Added `parentSaleItemId` to `GET /v1/sale-items` for identifying add-ons.\n- Added a new `unformatted` property to the `GET /v1/event-statistics` endpoint to prevent humanizing/formatting numerical statistics.\n\n#### 12th September 2025\n- Adding `billingDetails` object to the `GET /v1/config` endpoint.\n\n#### 14th August 2025\n - `POST /v1/basket-items` now accepts order item ID as well as sale item ID to add a resale item to basket. The `resaleFeeSellerContribution` has also been added and can be pasesed in `pointOfSaleData`\n\n#### 21st July 2025\n- Updated `POST /tickets/pair` to accept an `event-id` property in order to scope the possible list of matching order items. This is particularly useful for any users that re-use barcodes across events or schedules.\n\n#### 30th June 2025\n- Replace now unused `applyOncePerOrder` and `oneUsePerCustomer` attributes from discount code endpoints with the new `maxUsesPerOrder` and `maxUsesPerCustomer`\n  - `POST /v1/discount-codes/buy-x-get-y`\n  - `POST /v1/discount-codes/buy-x-get-y/update`\n  - `POST /v1/discount-codes/fixed`\n  - `POST /v1/discount-codes/fixed/update`\n  - `POST /v1/discount-codes/percentage`\n  - `POST /v1/discount-codes/percentage/update`\n\n#### 5th June 2025\n- Update `POST /basket-items` to return a `startBasketUrl` link to enter checkout for the basket, if `generateBasketUrl` is set to true on the request\n\n#### 2nd June 2025\n- Add `salePeriods` to includes on `GET /events` and `GET /event`\n\n#### 19th May 2025\n- Updated `GET /events` and `GET /event` to include a new seating plan `embedUrl`.\n- Updated `GET /events` and `GET /event` to include `eventSchedules.startDate` and `eventSchedules.endDate`.\n\n#### 14th April 2025\n- Updated `POST /zones/check` and `POST /zones/scan` to return a `statusDetail` field to embelish a `denied` response. Currently this only returns `historicBarcode` in the event a barcode has been scanned that has since been superceded by a new barcode following a transfer.\n- Updated `GET /entry/tickets` to return a `historicBarcodes` list within the `variable` portion of a ticket, which lists all previous barcodes of the ticket, in order to determine whether the customer is attempting to scan an old (possibly resold) ticket.\n\n#### 31st January 2025\n- `GET /events`, `GET /activated-events`, and `GET /future-events` now provide the company default header + thumbnail URL if the event does not have any media configured.\n\n#### 6th January 2025\n- Added `POST /customer-groups/customers` to add customers to a manual customer group\n- Added `POST /customer-groups/customers/delete` to remove customers from a manual customer group\n\n#### 18th December 2024\n- `GET /order-items` now correctly returns items from fully cancelled/refunded orders. Previously it would include refunded items if the order was only partially refunded.\n\n#### 13th December 2024\n- The customer update endpoint will now preserve existing customer address fields as long as no new address data is provided. Prior to this change, customer address fields would be cleared if no address data was provided within the payload.\n\n#### 3rd October 2024\n- Added `minPrice` and `maxPrice` to `GET /events` and `GET /event` as additional opt-in attributes\n- Updated the `lastUpdated` filter on `GET /events` so that it now considers pricing, venue & item updates.\n\n#### 5th September 2024\n- Added `appleWalletPassUrl` to `GET /orders`, `GET /order`, `GET /order-items` and `GET /order-item` for easy access to download an Apple Wallet pkpass file for each order item.\n\n#### 29th August 2024\n- Added `reserverName` to `GET /orders`, `GET /order`, and add `namedHolder` to the items within the same endpoints, as well as the `GET /order-items` endpoint\n- Added `phone` and `phoneCode` as fields that can be sent to `POST /customers/update` and `POST /customers`\n- Added `gatewayReference` to transactions `GET /transactions`, `GET /orders` and `GET /order`\n- Allow balance refunds and cancellations, as well as standard refunds on `POST /order-items/refund` and `POST /orders/refund` using the new `type` attribute in the request\n\n#### 24th July 2024\n- Added the `scheduleId` to the returned fields on `GET /events` and `GET /event` endpoints\n- Added `eventSchedules` as a possible include on `GET /events` and `GET /event` endpoints\n- Added a new filter to `GET /events` to allow filtering by `scheduleId`. Providing a null, zero, or empty value will return events that are outside of a schedule.\n- Added a new filter to `GET /events` to allow grouping of events by their respective schedule (`groupScheduledEvents`). Events without a schedule continue to be returned individually.\n\n#### 19th June 2024\n- Added `historicalBarcodes` to the include parameter for the below endpoints. New barcodes are generated when an order item is transfered or a barcode change is manually performed. This will return all historical barcodes associated with the order item.\n    - `GET /order-item`\n    - `GET /order-items`\n    - `GET /order`\n    - `GET /orders`\n- Added `variablePriceEnabled`, `variablePriceMin`, and `variablePriceMax` to `GET /sale-item` and `GET /sale-items` endpoints to indicate whether pricing is a customer selection.\n- Added `customPriceEnabled` and `customPriceRequired` to the documentation for `GET /sale-item` and `GET /sale-items` to indicate whether prices can be defined by staff users in mobile applications.\n- Marked the `GET /entry-tickets`, `POST /orders/upload`, `POST /wallets/nfc-download`, and `POST /wallets/nfc-download/confirm` endpoints as deprecated and likely to be removed in a future version of the API. Anyone using these endpoints should review the documentation to understand alternative provisions for the functionality being removed.\n- A display issue with the related space data for order items has been updated to return the seat/space name correctly, rather than the fully formatted string. This is a breaking change for anyone relying on the broken data previously being returned.\n- Resolved an issue with access to tickets that were sold by a parent company for a child company event on `GET /zones/items`, `GET /order-item` and `GET /order-items`.\n\n#### 20th May 2024\n- Ignore empty data capture responses on the `v1/data-capture-responses` endpoint\n\n#### 15th May 2024\n- Added `transactions` to the include parameter for the following endpoints:\n    - `GET /order-item`\n    - `GET /order-items`\n    - `GET /order`\n    - `GET /orders`\n\n- Improved consistency of currency attributes across various endpoints:\n    - Added `currencyId` to:\n        - `POST /orders/complete`\n        - `POST /order-items/refund`\n        - `GET /event-tickets`\n        - `GET /order-item`\n        - `GET /order-items`\n        - `POST /orders/refund`\n\n    - Added `currencyCode` to:\n        - `GET /basket`\n        - `POST /basket/discount`\n        - `POST /basket-items`\n        - `POST /basket-items/destroy`\n        - `POST /basket-items/update`\n        - `POST /orders/complete`\n        - `POST /orders/refund`\n        - `POST /order-items/refund`\n        - `GET /event-tickets`\n        - `GET /order-item`\n        - `GET /order-items`\n        - `GET /order`\n        - `GET /orders`\n        - `GET /sale-item`\n        - `GET /sale-items`\n\n    - Added `currencySymbol` to:\n        - `GET /basket`\n        - `POST /basket/discount`\n        - `GET /order-item`\n        - `GET /order-items`\n        - `POST /basket-items`\n        - `GET /sale-item`\n        - `GET /sale-items`\n\n    - Added `feeCurrencyId` to:\n        - `GET /order-item`\n        - `GET /order-items`\n\n    - Added `feeCurrencyCode` to:\n        - `GET /order-item`\n        - `GET /order-items`\n        - `GET /order`\n        - `GET /orders`\n\n    - Added `feeCurrencySymbol` to:\n        - `GET /order-item`\n        - `GET /order-items`\n\n- <span class='sl-text-lg sl-font-semibold sl-px-2.5 sl-py-1 sl-bg-primary sl-text-on-primary sl-rounded-lg'>New Feature</span> Added support for processing deposit payments:\n    - `POST /v1/checkout/create-payment-intent` and `POST /v1/orders/complete` both feature a new `paymentPlan` parameter for processing online/offline deposit payments.\n    - The orders API now features a new `paid` field in the response to indicate how much of the overall order total has been paid for.

`GET /zones/items`\n    - `GET /company/users`\n    - `GET /company/user`\n    - `GET /customers`\n    - `GET /customer`\n    - `GET /discount-codes`\n    - `GET /discount-code`\n    - `GET /event-tickets`\n    - `GET /events`\n    - `GET /event`\n    - `GET /inventory-items`\n    - `GET /order-items`\n    - `GET /order-item`\n    - `GET /orders`\n    - `GET /order`\n    - `GET /sale-items`\n    - `GET /zones/items`\n    - `GET /zones/all`\n- This `withTrashed` parameter acts as a global setting, meaning that all deleted resources will be returned, including any related resources appearing in the `included` attribute in the response.\n\n#### 18th November 2021\n\n- Added an array of Timeslot data to the `GET /activated-events` endpoint\n- Improved order search by adding a `query` parameter to the `GET /orders endpoint`, meaning you can now search orders by customer email, customer full name, order reference or event name.\n- New endpoint `POST /guestdata` added, which allows you to synchronise all guest list data to your access control device\n- New endpoint `PUT /guestdata` created, which allows you to update the current number of guests that have attended (for a particular guest list order item).\n- Added new `permissions` attribute to the `GET /activated-events` endpoint, containing information on whether the authenticated user can or cannot edit the event.\n- Added a new `hideAttendees` attribute to the `GET /zones/all` endpoint, allowing for us to control if the attendees tab in the access control app is or is not visible.\n\n",
