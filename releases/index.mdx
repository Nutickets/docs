#### 🚀 New Features


**Two factor authentication**

* [[NG-5058](https://linear.app/nuweb-group/issue/NG-5058)] Two-factor authentication (App-based 2FA) is now generally available in hub & admin:

**Unified shop login**

After much customer feedback, the login/registration step during checkout has received an upgrade to provide a *unified login experience*. This de-emphasises the need for customers to register just to place their order. The new experience reveals the appropriate actions for the user based on the email address entered:

* New users will be automatically presented with the *continue as guest* journey by default, with the option to register if they wish.
* If the email address belongs to an existing customer, the password field will be revieled to allow them to login.
* If a users previously logged in with a social login provider, then the system will visually indicate this to them so they can continue with their same account.

* Introducing fee hierarchy control - this control allows you to ensure only the most specific usage of the same fee item is applied.

This is configurable at the inventory level per fee.
* Optionally restrict fee sale items to only be applied to specific item types
