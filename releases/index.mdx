#### 🚀 New Features


**Two factor authentication**

**Unified shop login**

After much customer feedback, the login/registration step during checkout has received an upgrade to provide a *unified login experience*. This de-emphasises the need for customers to register just to place their order. The new experience reveals the appropriate actions for the user based on the email address entered:

* New users will be automatically presented with the *continue as guest* journey by default, with the option to register if they wish.
* If the email address belongs to an existing customer, the password field will be revieled to allow them to login.
* If a users previously logged in with a social login provider, then the system will visually indicate this to them so they can continue with their same account.

Below you will find the summary notes for the 39th release of the Nuweb core platform.


#### 🚀 New Features


**Improved sale item fees**

* Configure fee sale items to apply a variable, percentage based fee to orders as well as (or instead of) a fixed amount. The per item / once per order selection will determine how these variable fees are calculated.

 

<Frame caption="Variable fee setup for fee sale items"><img src="/images/releases/e395747af76b63b8a04cbce96ca5f50c.png" alt="Variable fee setup for fee sale items" /></Frame>



* Configuring pricing tiers for fees now allows you to apply different fees depending on the value of an item or order.

 

<Frame caption="Pricing tiers for fee sale items"><img src="/images/releases/ee150e70ba5e7057be6d6656dd6716e1.png" alt="Pricing tiers for fee sale items" /></Frame>



* Introducing fee hierarchy control - this control allows you to ensure only the most specific usage of the same fee item is applied. Fees applied to specific sale items will take priority, followed by event level fees, finally applying company level order fees if none of the others exist. This is configurable at the inventory level per fee.
* Optionally restrict fee sale items to only be applied to specific item types

* Allow event reminder emails to be configured at the company level within general settings, to dispatch for all events
