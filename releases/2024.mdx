Below you will find the summary notes for the 37th release of the Nuweb core platform.

</Note>




#### 🚀 New Features

#### Customer Groups

* Customers can now be added to groups based on a range of criteria relating to their purchase history. These groups can then be used to enforce purchase limitations, and offer discounts, for your most engaged, loyal and enthusiastic customers.

* Groups can either be manual (you handpick the members) or automated (you define the criteria):

  

<Frame caption="Customer groups list view"><img src="/images/releases/f075bba8cd1840303d58a14158e4f5dc.png" alt="Customer groups list view" /></Frame>




* Manual groups allow customers to be added or removed manually. Removal dates can be set when adding customers to remove the need for a manual removal process.

* Automated groups can define a number of rules, based on past purchasing behaviour of the customer, across a specific timeframe, to determine whether they are valid members of that group.

  

<Frame caption="Multiple rules can be configured using any / all operators."><img src="/images/releases/c1c1c13e05313729f5f38ca89ef60fe9.png" alt="Multiple rules can be configured using any / all operators." /></Frame>

* Customer groups can be used as a purchasing restriction for any sale or inventory item.

  

<Frame caption="Purchasing restrictions are now grouped together on the sale item form."><img src="/images/releases/1c2a208975df0c8ff3ea8275c7cd99ba.png" alt="Purchasing restrictions are now grouped together on the sale item form." /></Frame>

Below you will find the summary notes for the 30th release of the Nuweb core platform.


#### 🚀 New Features


**Schedules**

As part of our 3 part series of work re-iminaging how scheduled events can work across larger series of events, we've released the second phase of work on event schedules. This replaces multiple legacy concepts whilst delivering an improvement over mass assignment of tickets to events.

* You can now manage tickets and season tickets on the schedule dashboard [[NG-5282](https://linear.app/nuweb-group/issue/NG-5282)] 

<Frame caption="Assigning a ticket to all events in a schedule from the schedule dashboard."><img src="/images/releases/b76411ae21ebcf6c1b0d394f00c219e9.gif" alt="Assigning a ticket to all events in a schedule from the schedule dashboard." /></Frame>

* Custom cycles can now be used to create repeat schedules [[NG-5262](https://linear.app/nuweb-group/issue/NG-5262)]

  

<Frame caption="Select any dates to be repeated, without the need for a standard daily/weekly/monthly cycle. "><img src="/images/releases/f34bd071c2d5c04c5dae4b3c4bb1397c.png" alt="Select any dates to be repeated, without the need for a standard daily/weekly/monthly cycle. " /></Frame>

* Added visibility controls to the schedule dashboard [[NG-5432](https://linear.app/nuweb-group/issue/NG-5432)]

  

<Frame caption="Control each events visibility regardless of the schedule type."><img src="/images/releases/dd956cf2a88419f1d4fc0e9ab62a117b.png" alt="Control each events visibility regardless of the schedule type." /></Frame>


* Event organisers now have the ability to use the 'listing' view for repeat schedules, instead of this always defaulting to the calendar view [[NG-5283](https://linear.app/nuweb-group/issue/NG-5283)]
* \

**Split payments**

Our plans for 2024 include functionality that offers new payment methodology to customers - with the aim of improvement conversions, customer loyalty, and ultimately, revenues. Underpinning a lot of this work was the idea of split payments - using multiple payment methods to complete a single order. Once this functionality existed, it made sense to surface it as a directly usable feature within box office and the ticket shop.

* Split payments can be defined manually when using box office mode [[NG-4151](https://linear.app/nuweb-group/issue/NG-4151)]


<Frame caption="Multiple payment methods can be used to pay the balance of an order."><img src="/images/releases/87963e1c09b6f9c203d03248322883be.png" alt="Multiple payment methods can be used to pay the balance of an order." /></Frame>




* Added the ability to refund split payments both automatically matching the original transaction proportions, as well as manually allowing the user to set custom amounts for each transaction refund [[NG-5334](https://linear.app/nuweb-group/issue/NG-5334)]


<Frame caption="Refunds splits can be set automatically, matching the original transactions proportions."><img src="/images/releases/9f79dcdfe77d3a3e6fd0b4fbbcd815ef.png" alt="Refunds splits can be set automatically, matching the original transactions proportions." /></Frame>

<Frame caption="Refund splits can be set manually using any proportions set by the Admin user."><img src="/images/releases/313e18dd4a018f797c8c123b59d35ccf.png" alt="Refund splits can be set manually using any proportions set by the Admin user." /></Frame>

**Account balances / eWallets**

* Introduced account balance / e-wallet spending functionality within the ticket shop. eWallets can now be used to pay for an entire order or if used in combination with split payments, a portion of the order [[NG-5325](https://linear.app/nuweb-group/issue/NG-5325)]


<Frame caption="Balance spending can be enabled for both the Shop and Box Office separately."><img src="/images/releases/86dc9f97c0a86d6241d884306e17daab.png" alt="Balance spending can be enabled for both the Shop and Box Office separately." /></Frame>

* Define some new global user roles so that they don't need to be set up for each company: Scanning User, Cashless Shop User, Cashless Top Up user, Box Office User and Event Organizer (Basic) [[NG-5273](https://linear.app/nuweb-group/issue/NG-5273)]

  

<Frame><img src="/images/releases/967c5044e7dc5464c90e27f4074d2ee9.png" alt="" /></Frame>
