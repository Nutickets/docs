#### 💻 Technical

* Refactored the seating plan import experience:
  * Seating plan importing is now batched into smaller tasks, allowing larger plans to be imported more reliably.
  * Doing this also means that other customers/clients aren't impacted whilst we wait for a large plan to import.
  * The UI has been updated to show the progress so that the spinner has more context than 'please wait'.
* Refactored: Bulk Event Copying + Bulk Timeslot Creation Experience
  * As with the seating plan changes, the copy event + bulk timeslot processes were refined in order to utilise the same batching process as with seating plans.
* Add: A delta availability payload on seating planned events, in the shop.
  * This allows a much smaller amount of data to be downloaded, to keep seating plan availability up-to-date, by passing a 'last updated' timestamp and receiving a delta payload of any changes since then.
* Refactored: Availability information for seating plans, to be more performant - especially on larger seating plans.
* Cookie banner now respects the 'base domain' setting in Admin (if available) to allow cookie banner to work on custom domains.
* Fix: When part way through a form wizard (i.e. event creation), if users changed companies in another tab, the original form wizard could still be submitted with objects that weren't owned by the new company (i.e. venues)
* Fixed a timezone conversion bug post-release, all effected timeslots have now been corrected
* Fixed performance issues within accounts with large numbers of tickets and events where bulk editing became temporarily unusable.

#### API Updates

* Added full set of API endpoints to accomodate offline entry scanning
* Added NFC pairing API endpoints allowing tickets to be paired with NFC tags
* Added a 'lastUpdated' filter to several endpoints (GET /customers, GET /orders/items, GET/events) to allow filtering of data based on the modified time
* Various fields have been added to make linking and filtering data easier: Customer ID has been added to any endpoints that include order information, added the ability to include order items when retrieving orders in bulk, added separate first and last name fields when retrieving customers, add created and updated at timestamps to all events and tickets, added event ID where missing, made eventId optional when retrieving tickets, restructured event codes to lighten the payloads for accounts that have lots of internal data capture questions.
