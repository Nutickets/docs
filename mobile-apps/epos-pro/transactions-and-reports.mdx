## Overview

EPOS Pro provides tools for reviewing past transactions, processing full or partial refunds, collecting pre-purchased products, and viewing sales reports — both from the server and from the local device. These features are accessed from the **Transactions**, **Sales Report**, and **Collect Purchases** tiles on the home screen.

## Transaction History

Tap **Transactions** from the home screen to view all transactions for the current shop. This tile requires the `viewListOfOrders` permission.

### Browsing Transactions

Transactions are displayed in a list sorted by date (most recent first). Each entry shows the order reference, customer name, total, and payment method. Pull down to refresh the list.

### Searching

The search bar at the top filters transactions by:

- **Order reference** (partial match)
- **Customer name** (partial match)
- **Customer ID** (exact match)

### Transaction Details

Tap a transaction to view its full details:

- **Order reference** and **date**
- **Customer name**
- **Payment method** (Cash, Card, Account Balance, Complimentary)
- **Total payment** amount
- **Order items** — each product with its quantity and price, plus refund status

In online mode, the app fetches the latest transaction data from the server. In offline mode, it displays data from the local database.

## Refunds

Refunds are processed from the transaction detail screen. The app supports both full and partial refunds — you can refund individual items from an order without affecting the rest.

### Processing a Refund

1. Open the transaction you want to refund
2. Tap the items you want to refund — selected items are highlighted
3. Tap **Refund** to proceed to the confirmation screen

Items that have already been refunded are marked and cannot be selected again.

### Confirming the Refund

The confirmation screen shows the selected items and the total refund amount. How confirmation works depends on the authentication mode:

- **QR mode** — tap the **Confirm** button to process
- **NFC Online mode** — tap the customer's NFC tag to confirm and process

In NFC mode, the app validates that the NFC tag belongs to the same customer who made the original purchase. If the tag belongs to a different customer, the refund is blocked with the message: *"Refund is not possible, as this NFC tag doesn't belong to [name] who made this transaction."*

### After the Refund

On success, the refund amount is added back to the customer's account balance (for balance payments) and a confirmation screen is shown with the refund details. The original transaction is updated to show the refunded items.

Refunded transactions appear in the transaction list with a **Refunded** or **Partially refunded** status.

<Note>
Refunds require the `refund` permission. If you don't have this permission, the refund button is not visible on the transaction detail screen.
</Note>

## Product Collection

Product collection allows staff to mark pre-purchased products as physically collected by the customer. This is useful at events where customers buy products online and pick them up at a collection point.

Tap **Collect Purchases** from the home screen to begin.

### Collection Flow

1. Identify the customer by scanning their QR code or tapping their NFC media
2. The app displays the customer's uncollected purchases, organised by category
3. Select the items being collected (use **Select All** to check everything, or tap individual items)
4. Tap **Continue Collection** to review the summary
5. Confirm the collection

After confirmation, the success screen displays the collected items. Staff can view previously collected items by tapping **View Collected Items** from the collection screen.

### Collection Options

In settings, the **Collection option** controls when products are marked as collected:

- **Collect now** — products are marked as collected immediately during the confirmation step
- **Collect later** — products are flagged for deferred collection

## Sales Reports

Tap **Sales Report** from the home screen to view sales data. This tile requires the `report` permission. The reports screen offers three views:

### Sales

The sales view shows revenue statistics fetched from the server, with a time filter:

| Filter | Shows |
|--------|-------|
| **Today** | Sales from the current day |
| **This Week** | Sales from the current week |
| **All Time** | All recorded sales |

The report breaks down totals by payment method:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cash sales** | Revenue from cash payments |
| **Card sales** | Revenue from card payments |
| **eWallet online sales** | Revenue from online account balance payments |
| **eWallet offline sales** | Revenue from offline NFC balance payments |
| **Online refunds** | Refunds processed online |
| **Offline refunds** | Refunds processed offline |
| **Total NET** | Net revenue after refunds |

### Products (Catalog)

The products view shows the full product catalogue for the current shop. Each product displays:

- Product name, image, and category
- Price and price type (**fixed** or **variable** for custom-priced items)
- Stock levels: **Sold Today**, total stock, and **Remaining** (or unlimited)
- On-sale / off-sale status

Use the search bar to filter by product name.

### Transactions

Opens the transaction history view described above.

## Local Device Report

In **NFC Offline** mode, an additional **Sales report from this device** section appears in the reports view. This report is generated from transactions stored in the local database — useful when the device has been operating offline and transactions have not yet synced.

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total sales (excluding refunds)** | Revenue from locally recorded sales |
| **Total refunds** | Value of locally recorded refunds |
| **Number of sold items (excluding refunded)** | Count of items sold |
| **Number of refunded items** | Count of items refunded |

The local report can be filtered by:
- **Shop scope** — current shop only or all shops
- **Date** — filter to transactions since a specific date

## Orders Upload Status

In offline mode, the reports screen also shows an **Orders upload status** section that tracks the sync state of locally stored transactions:

- **Pending uploads** — the number of unsynced sales, top-ups, and cash-outs
- **Most recent upload** — the timestamp and result of the last sync attempt (success, failure, or no connection)
- **Device identifier** — the unique ID of this device

If uploads are failing, a **Retry orders upload** option is available. This requeues all local transactions for upload.

<Note>
The retry button is intentionally hidden by default. Tap the **Orders upload status** area five times to reveal it. This prevents accidental retries that could duplicate data if a sync is already in progress.
