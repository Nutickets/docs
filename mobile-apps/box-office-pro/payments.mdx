## Overview

After building a basket and tapping **Checkout**, the payment screen shows the total and the available payment methods. Methods can be used individually or combined through split payments, and each can be toggled in [settings](/mobile-apps/box-office-pro/settings-and-hardware).

## Payment Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cash** | Staff collects cash from the customer. Optionally calculates change. |
| **Card reader** | Processes a card payment via a connected Stripe Bluetooth reader. |
| **Tap to pay** | Processes a contactless card payment using the device's built-in NFC. No external reader required. |
| **Card (online)** | Processes an online card payment (card not present) via the Stripe payment sheet on the device. |
| **Card (offline)** | Records a card-present payment processed outside the app. |

<Note>
**Card reader** and **Tap to pay** both use Stripe Terminal but connect differently — one via an external Bluetooth reader, the other via the device's own NFC hardware. Both require a Stripe reader to be [connected in settings](/mobile-apps/box-office-pro/settings-and-hardware#stripe-card-reader).
</Note>

## Paying with Cash

1. Select **Cash** from the payment method list
2. Enter the cash amount received using the numeric input (the field shows *"Enter amount"*)
3. The screen calculates and displays either:
   - **Change due** — when the cash covers the total. The **Pay** button becomes active.
   - **Remaining cost** — when the cash is less than the total. The **Pay** button remains disabled (unless split payments are enabled).
4. Tap **Pay** to complete the cash payment

If the **Cash input and change** setting is disabled, cash payments complete immediately without the amount entry step.

An **Open cash drawer** button appears during cash payments if you have the required permission and a Sunmi cash drawer is connected.

## Paying with Card Reader or Tap to Pay

1. Select **Card reader** or **Tap to pay**
2. The app creates a payment intent with the server and connects to the Stripe reader
3. The screen shows live status updates from the reader:
   - *"Preparing payment"* → *"Insert card"* or *"Ready"* → *"Processing"*
4. The customer presents their card (insert, tap, or swipe depending on the reader)
5. On success, the screen shows *"Payment Successful!"* and the order completes automatically

If the reader is not connected, the screen displays *"Terminal is not connected"* with an **Open terminal settings** button to configure the reader.

### Interac Support

For Canadian operations, Interac debit payments can be enabled alongside Stripe Terminal. When enabled, the terminal automatically handles Interac transactions without additional steps from the staff member.

## Paying with Card (Online)

1. Select **Card (online)**
2. The Stripe payment sheet opens automatically, displaying card entry fields
3. The customer (or staff member) enters card details
4. On success, the screen shows *"Payment Successful!"*

If the payment is cancelled or fails, the app returns to the payment method selection so you can try again.

## Split Payments

When split payments are enabled, staff can collect payment across multiple methods for a single order. This is useful when a customer wants to pay part in cash and part by card.

### How Split Payments Work

1. Select a payment method and enter an amount that is **less** than the total
2. The partial payment is recorded and the screen resets to payment method selection
3. The **Remaining cost** updates to show what's still owed
4. Select another payment method for the remainder
5. Repeat until the full amount is collected

The **Previous payments** section tracks each split. When fewer than three splits have been recorded, each one is listed individually showing the method and amount. With three or more, they collapse into a summary row showing the combined total — tap it to expand the full list.

<Note>
If a payment fails during a split (e.g., a card is declined), the failed split is automatically removed so you can retry with the same or different method.
</Note>

## After Payment

When the final payment is collected, the order is created on the server and a confirmation screen appears showing:

- **Payment completed** heading
- **Confirmation number** for the order
- Customer name and email (if provided)
- **Total paid** amount
- **Change** amount (for cash payments)

The confirmation screen offers these actions:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cash drawer** | Opens the cash drawer (requires permission and connected hardware) |
| **Admit** | Checks in all tickets on the order immediately (if check-in is configured — see [settings](/mobile-apps/box-office-pro/settings-and-hardware#check-in-after-purchase)) |
| **Print** | Prints tickets with QR barcodes on a connected Sunmi printer |
| **Print receipt** | Prints a financial receipt |
| **Buy more** | Starts a new order for the same customer (keeps name and email) |
| **New customer** | Clears the basket and customer data to start a fresh order |

<Note>
**Buy more** only appears when a customer name was entered. If the order was a guest checkout, only **New customer** is shown.
</Note>

### NFC Ticket Pairing

If NFC pairing is enabled in settings and the order contains tickets configured for NFC, the app enters a pairing flow after payment. Each ticket is presented one at a time — tap the customer's NFC tag to pair it with the ticket. You can skip individual tickets or cancel the entire pairing process.

For details on how NFC pairing works, including tag types and credit transfers, see [Orders and After the Sale](/mobile-apps/box-office-pro/orders-and-after-the-sale#nfc-ticket-pairing).

## Payment Errors

| Error | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| *"Terminal is not connected"* | No Stripe reader paired — open terminal settings to connect |
| *"Payment failed"* | Card declined or reader error — retry or use a different method |
| *"Processing payment failed"* | Payment confirmation failed after card was read |
| *"Capturing payment failed"* | Server could not capture the authorised payment |
| *"Creating payment failed. Please make sure you have internet connection."* | No network connectivity for online payment |
| *"Do you want to cancel payment?"* | Shown when pressing back during an active payment |

All error states include a **Retry** button to attempt the payment again.
