## Overview

The **Orders** screen — accessed from the main menu — covers order history, refunds, check-in, NFC pairing, and receipt printing.

## Order History

Tap **Orders** from the menu to view all orders. The list shows each order's reference number, customer name, total amount, date, and status badge (**Completed** or **Refunded**).

### Searching Orders

The search bar at the top filters orders by reference number or customer name. Pull down on the list to refresh with the latest data from the server.

<Note>
If there are no orders to display, the screen shows *"There are no orders."* If the device has no connection, it shows *"Make sure you have internet connection."*
</Note>

## Order Details

Tap an order to view its full details:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Order reference** | The unique order identifier |
| **Net** | Order total excluding tax |
| **Tax** | Tax amount |
| **Total** | Full order total |
| **Completed on** | Date and time the order was placed |
| **Customer** | Customer name (if assigned) |
| **Payment method** | Payment method(s) used, shown as a comma-separated list |

### Order Items

Below the summary, the **Order items** section lists each item in the order:

- Event name and ticket type (or product name)
- Barcode identifier
- Price
- **REFUNDED** label (displayed above the price if the item has been refunded, with the row dimmed)

## Refunding an Order

The **Refund order** button at the bottom of the order details screen processes a full refund of the entire order. Partial refunds (refunding individual items) are not available in the app — use the admin panel for item-level refunds.

When you tap **Refund order**:

1. The app sends the refund request to the server
2. On success, the button is disabled and a confirmation appears: *"Refund succeeded"*
3. The customer is notified by email automatically
4. Inventory is restocked

If the order has already been refunded, the button is disabled. Attempting to refund an already-refunded order from another session shows: *"This order is already refunded."*

<Note>
Refunds require internet connectivity. If the request fails, the app displays *"Refund failed"* — check your connection and try again.
</Note>

## Resending Confirmation Emails

Tap **Resend confirmation email** on the order details screen to send the order confirmation email again. On success, the app confirms: *"Confirmation email sent."*

## Printing from Order Details

The **Print** button on the order details screen reprints the full order — tickets with QR barcodes and a receipt (if receipt printing is enabled). This uses the same Sunmi printer output as the post-purchase print.

## Check-In After Purchase

When configured in [settings](/mobile-apps/box-office-pro/settings-and-hardware#check-in-after-purchase), staff can check in all tickets on an order immediately after completing a sale. This is useful at venues where ticket purchase and entry happen at the same point.

The check-in setting has three modes:

| Mode | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| **Disabled** | No check-in option shown after purchase |
| **Admit button** | An **Admit** button appears on the confirmation screen. Tapping it shows a confirmation: *"Do you want to proceed checking in all the tickets purchased?"* |
| **Auto admit** | All tickets are checked in automatically as soon as the order completes — no button press required |

On success, the button is disabled and a confirmation appears: *"Tickets checked in."* If check-in fails (e.g., no connection), the app shows: *"Checking in failed, please make sure you have internet connection and try again."*

## NFC Ticket Pairing

When NFC pairing is enabled in settings and the order contains tickets configured for NFC, the app enters a pairing flow after payment. This pairs each ticket to a physical NFC tag (wristband, card, or badge) so the customer can use it for entry and cashless payments.

### How Pairing Works

Tickets are presented one at a time, showing the event name, dates, and ticket type. For each ticket:

1. The app prompts you to tap the customer's NFC tag against the device
2. The tag is read, and the ticket is paired via the server
3. A success message confirms: *"Pairing ticket succeeded"*
4. The app advances to the next ticket (or returns to the confirmation screen if all tickets are paired)

You can skip individual tickets by tapping **Next ticket**, or cancel the entire process with **Cancel pairing**. A confirmation dialog asks: *"Are you sure you wish to proceed without pairing tickets to the wristbands?"*

### Pairing with Credits

When tickets are configured for NFC pairing with credits, the process is more involved:

1. The NFC tag is personalised (prepared for data storage)
2. If the tag is already linked to a **different customer** who has credits, the app asks for confirmation: *"This tag is linked to [name] which have [amount] credits. Please confirm that you want to cash out the credits and link this tag to [name]"*
3. The ticket is paired on the server
4. The customer's online wallet balance is downloaded and written to the NFC tag
5. The tag is updated with the new customer data, credits, and ticket information

<Note>
During NFC tag writing, a progress message appears: *"Pairing in progress... Please do not remove the TAG until it is completed."* If the tag is removed too early or cannot be read, the app prompts you to tap again.
</Note>

### Re-Pairing

If a ticket has already been paired to an NFC tag, the app asks for confirmation before overwriting:

- *"This ticket has been already paired, please confirm that you want to re-pair this ticket with this tag"*
- For tags already paired to the same ticket: *"This ticket is already paired with this tag. Please confirm that you want to pair again"*

### Tag Conflicts

Several conflict scenarios are handled:

| Situation | Message |
|-----------|---------|
| Tag already paired to another ticket for the same customer and event | *"This NFC tag is already paired with another ticket for this event, that belongs to the same customer"* |
| Tag already used for this event (with credits mode) | *"Tag already used for this event"* |
| Tag from a different company | *"Tap again with NFC tag and do not remove it until operation is completed. Make sure that this NFC tag is not used by different company."* |

## Receipt Printing

Box Office Pro prints tickets and receipts on **Sunmi** devices with a built-in thermal printer. Printing happens automatically after a sale (when configured) and can also be triggered from the order details screen.

### Ticket Printout

Each ticket prints on its own section of paper:

- Event name (large, bold)
- Venue name
- Event date and time
- Ticket type and price
- Seat location (for seated events)
- Customer name (unless guest checkout)
- QR barcode (scannable for entry)

### Receipt Printout

The receipt prints after all tickets and includes:

- Order reference and date
- Itemised list with event names, ticket names, prices, and barcodes
- Net, tax, and total amounts
- Company name, address, and VAT number
- Payment method(s) used

### Paper Cutting

On Sunmi devices, paper cutting can be configured in [settings](/mobile-apps/box-office-pro/settings-and-hardware#receipt-printing):

| Option | Behaviour |
|--------|-----------|
| **Disabled** | No automatic paper cutting |
| **After each ticket** | Cuts after every individual ticket prints |
| **After printing order** | Cuts once after all tickets and the receipt have printed |
