## Overview

After selecting an event from the listing screen, you move into the ticket selection flow. This involves choosing a timeslot (if the event has them), selecting ticket types and quantities, optionally picking seats from a seating plan, and building a basket. The app also supports add-ons, discount codes, and customer assignment before checkout.

## Choosing a Timeslot

If the event uses timeslots, a filter at the top of the ticket screen lets you choose which timeslot to shop:

- **Whole event** — shows tickets available across the entire event
- **Individual timeslots** — shows tickets specific to a particular time window

Timeslots that are off sale or out of stock are hidden from the list. The display shows either the timeslot's custom name or its start and end times.

Tickets are grouped into two sections:

- **Available for the whole event** — tickets that are not tied to any specific timeslot
- **Timeslot-specific sections** — tickets assigned to individual timeslots

## Selecting Tickets

Each ticket type in the list displays:

- **Name** and **price** (in the selected currency)
- **Stock** count (when stock is limited)
- **Status badges** where applicable:

| Badge | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Bundle** | Ticket is part of a bundle package |
| **Season ticket** | A season pass rather than a single-event ticket |
| **Product** | A physical product rather than a ticket |
| **Has add-ons** | Optional add-on items are available for this ticket |
| **Out of stock** | No inventory remaining — quantity controls hidden |
| **Off sale** | Outside the sale window — quantity controls hidden |

Use the **+** and **-** buttons to adjust quantities. The app enforces any configured quantity rules:

- **Minimum order quantity** — you cannot add fewer than the minimum (reducing below it removes the item entirely)
- **Maximum order quantity** — the quantity caps at the configured maximum
- **Multiples of** — quantities snap to the required increment (e.g., multiples of 2)

<Note>
A maximum of 50 items can be added to a single order.
</Note>

### Add-Ons

When you add a ticket that has optional add-ons, a dialog appears showing the available add-on items. Adjust the quantity of each add-on using **+** and **-** buttons in the dialog. Add-ons appear indented under their parent ticket in the basket and are removed automatically if the parent ticket is removed.

## Seating Plans

For seated events, the ticket selection screen can switch between two views:

- **List** — the standard ticket list described above
- **Seating plan** — an interactive map of the venue

### Selecting Seats

The seating plan loads as an interactive map where you can tap individual seats. When you tap a seat:

1. If only one ticket type matches the seat's price band, it is added to the basket immediately
2. If multiple ticket types are available for that seat, a **Select ticket** dialog asks you to choose which type

Selected seats are highlighted on the plan. To remove a seat, tap it again or delete it from the basket.

An area filter dropdown at the top lets you narrow the seating plan to a specific section of the venue.

### Table Bookings

For venues with table seating where individual seat selection is not allowed, the system waits until all seats at a table are selected before adding the tickets to the basket.

### Best Available Seats

When adding tickets for a seated event via the list view (rather than picking specific seats on the plan), the app requests the best available seats automatically. The server assigns optimal seats based on availability.

## The Basket

The basket screen shows everything you've selected so far. A countdown timer at the top tracks the basket's expiry — when it reaches zero, items are released back on sale and you're returned to the event listing.

### Basket Contents

Each line in the basket shows the item name, price, and quantity. Additional details appear where relevant:

- **Seated tickets** show the seat location (e.g., *"Section A, Row 12, Seat 5"*) with a **Delete** button for individual removal
- **Add-ons** appear indented under their parent ticket with a visual connector
- **Fees** appear as separate line items (display only, no quantity controls)

The basket footer shows:

- **Discount** amount (if a code has been applied)
- **Total** order value

### Adjusting Quantities

For non-seated tickets, the same **+** / **-** controls from the ticket selection screen appear in the basket. Changes sync with the server to validate stock availability. A progress indicator appears during sync, and buttons are temporarily disabled until the update completes.

### Discount Codes

Tap **Add code** to apply a discount code. A dialog asks for the code — enter it and tap **Apply**. On success, the basket total updates and a confirmation appears: *"Discount code applied successfully."*

<Note>
You must have items in the basket before applying a discount code. Attempting to add a code to an empty basket shows: *"Add items to basket before adding discount code."*
</Note>

If the code is invalid, the app displays: *"Discount code is invalid."* If there's no connection, you'll see: *"Discount code not applied, please make sure you have internet connection."*

### Customer Details

Two optional fields let you assign the order to a customer:

- **Customer name** — free text
- **Customer email** — validated email address

Both fields are optional. Leaving them blank creates a guest order. If you provide one, you must provide the other:

- Name without email → *"Please enter an email address or remove the name to checkout as a guest"*
- Email without name → *"Please enter a name or remove the email address to checkout as a guest"*

A QR scanner button lets you scan a customer's barcode to auto-fill their name and email from the system.

### Basket Expiry

The countdown timer at the top of the basket tracks the expiry time set by the server. When the timer reaches zero, the basket expires and a message appears: *"Your basket has timed out. Items are released back on sale after expiry."* You are returned to the event listing to start a new order.

### Proceeding to Checkout

Tap **Checkout** to move to the payment screen. If the basket is empty, the app shows *"Basket is empty"* and returns to the previous screen.

If the order total is zero (e.g., all complimentary items), the app skips the payment screen and completes the order directly.
