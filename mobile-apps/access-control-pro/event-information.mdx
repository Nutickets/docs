## Overview

The event screen tabs give operators visibility into attendance data, ticket breakdowns, and guest lists without switching to the admin panel.

## Event Info Tab

The **Info** tab is the event dashboard within the app. It displays a summary of the event alongside detailed breakdowns by ticket type, timeslot, and gate.

### Event Summary

At the top, the event card shows:

- Event name, date, and venue
- The event's [scanning mode](/core-platform/event-management/access-control#scanning-mode) (QR Only, Secure QR Only, or NFC)
- Event thumbnail image
- **Ticket attendance** — how many tickets have been scanned out of the total, with a percentage (e.g. "150 / 500")
- **Guest attendance** — how many guests have been checked in out of the total
- A download progress indicator while ticket data is still syncing to the device

### Gates

Below the event summary, each gate configured on the event is listed with:

- Gate name
- Number of tickets scanned through that gate
- Active/inactive status on this device (green or red indicator)

Tap a gate to toggle whether this device accepts tickets assigned to that gate. See [filtering scans](/mobile-apps/access-control-pro/scanning-and-admission#filtering-scans-by-ticket-type-and-gate) for details.

### Timeslots

If the event has [timeslots](/core-platform/event-management/timeslots), each timeslot is displayed with its name, date range, and attendance figures. The currently active timeslot (based on the current time) is automatically expanded.

Tap a timeslot to expand or collapse it, revealing the individual ticket types within that timeslot along with their attendance stats and active/inactive status.

### Ticket Types

Ticket types that are not part of any timeslot are listed separately under a **Ticket types** section. Each ticket type shows:

- Type name
- Attendance text (scanned / total)
- Percentage scanned
- Active/inactive indicator

Tap a ticket type to toggle it. A confirmation dialog asks:
- *"Do you want to disable the scanning/admission of this ticket type on this device?"* — or the reverse to enable it

This is how operators restrict a device to only scan specific ticket types at an entry point.

## Attendees Tab

The **Attendees** tab shows a searchable list of every ticket holder for the event.

### Searching and Filtering

- **Search** — type a customer name to filter the list in real time
- **Timeslot filter** — if the event has timeslots, a filter button lets you narrow the list to a specific timeslot or view all
- **Tickets / Products toggle** — switch between viewing ticket-type items and product-type items

### Attendee Information

Each row in the list shows:

- Customer name
- Customer email
- Ticket type
- Timeslot (if applicable)
- Barcode
- A check mark icon if the attendee has been admitted

The list supports alphabetical fast-scroll indexing for quick navigation through large attendee lists.

### Scanning from the List

Tap any attendee row to open their scan result — the same screen you would see after scanning their barcode. This is useful for manually checking or admitting someone when their barcode cannot be scanned.

## Guest Lists Tab

The **Guest lists** tab shows all guest lists configured for the event. Guest lists are managed from the admin panel but can be checked in from the app.

### Guest List Overview

Each guest list displays:

- Guest list name
- Attendance count (checked in / total)
- A visual doughnut chart showing the percentage checked in

Tap a guest list to open it and see the individual guests.

### Guest Detail

Tapping a guest opens their detail screen showing:

- Full name
- Guest list name
- Attended count (how many of their allocated spots have been used)
- Price per guest
- Who added the guest (**Added by** field)
- Notes (if any were added in the admin panel)
- Last entry timestamp (if they have been checked in at least once)

### Checking In Guests

Use the **+** and **-** buttons on the guest detail screen to increment or decrement the guest's attended count. Each change is saved immediately and synced to the server.

This manual increment/decrement approach suits guest lists where the entry count matters — for example, a guest with 4 spots can have their count increased each time a member of their party arrives.
