## Overview

- Customer merge combines a duplicate customer into a final customer record.
- The workflow is transactional and moves linked records to the target customer.
- A merge history record is stored for audit and timeline review.

## Merge Behaviour

During merge, the platform reassigns linked records such as:

- orders and order items
- data-capture responses
- transfers and transaction requests
- addresses and supported provider identities
- customer-group memberships

When account balances are enabled, wallet funds are transferred as part of merge handling.

## Constraints

Merges are blocked when:

- either record belongs to admin/hub user identities
- records belong to different companies
- required merge permissions or feature access are missing
