description: "Consolidate duplicate customer records into a single profile, preserving all orders, tickets, account balances, and linked activity."

## Overview

When the same person ends up with multiple customer records — perhaps from checking out as a guest and later creating an account, or being added separately through box office and online — you can merge them into one. The merge process moves all orders, tickets, account balances, authentication providers, and other linked data into the chosen primary record, then removes the duplicate.

Merging is permanent and cannot be undone. A merge history log is created for audit purposes.

<Note>
Customer merging requires the merge customers feature to be enabled for your company.
</Note>

## Starting a Merge

1. Navigate to the customer profile of the record you want to **keep** (the primary customer).
2. Click **Merge Customer** in the sidebar actions.

This opens the merge panel.

## Searching for the Duplicate

The merge panel opens with a search field. Type the name or email address of the duplicate customer you want to merge into this account.

Search results show each customer's name, email, and customer ID. Click a result to select it as the duplicate.

<Note>
Only customers from the same company can be merged. If the customer you're looking for belongs to a different company, the search will not return them.
</Note>

## Reviewing the Comparison

After selecting the duplicate, the panel shows a side-by-side comparison:

| Side | Indicator | What Happens |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Left (red)** | "This customer will be deleted" | The duplicate customer. Their record will be removed after the merge. |
| **Right (green)** | "This customer will be updated" | The primary customer. All data will be consolidated into this record. |

If you selected the wrong customer, click **Change customer** to go back and search again.

## Resolving Conflicts

The panel displays each profile field that differs between the two customers. For each field, you choose which value to keep on the merged record.

| Field | How Conflicts Appear |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Name** | Shown if the customers have different names. |
| **Email** | Shown if the email addresses differ. |
| **Phone Code** | Shown if either customer has a phone country code. |
| **Phone Number** | Shown if either customer has a phone number. |
| **Date of Birth** | Shown if either customer has a date of birth on file. |
| **Address** | Shown as a complete address block (address lines, city, region, country, postcode). Selecting an address applies all address fields together. |

Each field displays:
- A **No Conflict** badge (green) if only one customer has a value, or both have the same value. The available value is used automatically.
- A **Conflict** badge (red) if the values differ. Click on the value you want to keep — it shows **Selected** with a checkmark, while the other appears struck through.

## What Gets Moved

The following data is automatically transferred from the duplicate to the primary customer during the merge. This is not configurable — all linked records are moved.

| Data | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| **Orders** | All orders are reassigned to the primary customer. |
| **Order items** | All tickets, products, guest list entries, and other purchased items are reassigned. |
| **Data capture responses** | All data capture answers are moved to the primary customer. |
| **Authentication providers** | Social login connections (SSO) are moved. If the primary customer already has the same provider connected, the duplicate's version is removed to prevent login conflicts. |
| **Customer group memberships** | Group memberships are merged. If the primary customer is already in a group, the duplicate membership for that group is removed. Otherwise, the membership (including removal date) is transferred. |
| **Account balances** | If account balances are enabled, funds from each of the duplicate's currency wallets are transferred to the primary customer via a balance transfer. |
| **Addresses** | Saved addresses are moved to the primary customer. |
| **Item transfers** | Transfer records (both sent and received) are reassigned. |
| **Customer effort scores** | Feedback responses are moved to the primary customer. |

After all data is moved, the duplicate customer record is deleted.

<Note>
Orders retain their original **created by** attribution. If an order was created by a different admin user, that attribution is preserved — only the customer ownership changes.
</Note>

## Confirming the Merge

Before submitting, you must acknowledge the terms:

> You acknowledge that merging these customer accounts is permanent and will modify associated data in a way that cannot be undone or recovered.

Check the acknowledgement box to enable the **Submit** button. Once confirmed, the merge executes and you are redirected to the primary customer's profile with a confirmation message: **Customer records merged successfully.**

## When Merges Are Blocked

The merge cannot proceed if any of the following apply:

| Condition | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Either customer is an admin user | Admin user accounts cannot be merged to prevent disruption to system access and audit trails. |
| Either customer is a hub user | Hub user accounts are similarly protected. |
| Customers belong to different companies | Cross-company merges are not supported. The search only returns customers from the same company. |
| Merge feature is not enabled | The merge customers feature must be enabled for your company. |
| Insufficient permissions | You must have edit permissions on customer records. |

## Merge History

After a merge, the primary customer's profile displays a **Merge history** section. Click it to see a chronological list of all merges into this customer, showing:

- The date and time of the merge
- Which customer was merged in (by customer ID)
- The name and email of the admin who performed the merge

This history is permanent and provides an audit trail for all consolidation activity on the account.
