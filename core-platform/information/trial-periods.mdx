## Overview

Trial periods give companies time-limited access to the platform. A reseller creates a trial account with an expiration date, and users can access all features normally until that date passes. When a trial expires, access is restricted until the reseller activates the account.

## While the Trial Is Active

During an active trial, the platform works normally with no restrictions on features. As the expiration approaches, a banner appears at the top of the admin panel:

> Your **trial period** will expire in **[time remaining]**. Please contact **[reseller name]** to activate your account, or to extend the trial period.

The remaining time is displayed in the most appropriate unit — days, hours, or minutes — depending on how close the expiration is.

## What Happens When a Trial Expires

When a trial period ends, access is restricted across the platform:

### Admin Panel

Users are blocked from accessing the admin panel for the expired company. What happens next depends on whether the user has access to other companies:

| Situation | Behaviour |
|-----------|-----------|
| User has access to other active companies | Automatically redirected to another company with a notification: "The trial period for company '[expired company]' has expired. You have automatically been redirected to company '[available company]'." |
| User has no other companies | Shown an error page: "Your trial account has expired. Please contact [reseller name] to activate your account." |

### API Access

API requests to an expired trial company are blocked with a 403 Forbidden response. Any integrations relying on the API will stop working until the account is activated.

### Company Switching

Users cannot [switch](/core-platform/information/company-switching) to a company with an expired trial. Attempting to do so displays:

> You cannot switch to company "[company name]", because its trial has expired.

The expired company remains visible in the company list but cannot be selected.

## Trial Company Resources

Companies created as trials start with a limited set of resources:

- A single currency
- A single language
- A single country
- The reseller's available payment gateways

These restrictions keep the setup simple for evaluation purposes. Once the trial is activated, additional currencies, languages, and countries can be enabled.

## Extending or Activating a Trial

Trial periods are managed by your reseller. To continue using the platform after a trial expires, contact your reseller to either:

- **Extend the trial** — the expiration date is pushed forward, restoring access
- **Activate the account** — the expiration is removed entirely, converting the trial into a full account with no time limit

<Note>
Activating an account does not change any data, settings, or content created during the trial period. Everything you set up during the trial is preserved.
