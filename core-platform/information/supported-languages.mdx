## Overview

The platform supports over 30 languages, allowing you to serve customers in their preferred language. Each company selects which languages to enable, and customers can switch between them when browsing your event shop. Content fields throughout the platform support translations, so you can provide localised event descriptions, item names, and more.

## Enabling Languages for Your Company

Companies choose which languages to make available:

1. Navigate to company settings
2. In the **Languages** section, select the languages you want to enable
3. Save your changes

You must enable at least one language. The language you designate becomes your **fallback language**.

### Fallback Language

The fallback language serves two purposes:

- It is the **default language** presented to customers before they customise their preferences
- It provides **fallback content** when a translation is missing for the customer's selected language

You can change which language is the fallback at any time. If you remove the current fallback language from your enabled list, the first remaining language becomes the new fallback.

## How Customers Switch Languages

Customers can select their preferred language from the language selector on your event shop. The platform determines which language to display using the following priority:

1. **Explicit selection** — if the customer has previously chosen a language (via the language selector or a `?language=` URL parameter)
2. **Domain-based language** — if you have configured language-specific domains
3. **Browser language** — the platform checks the customer's browser language preferences and uses the first match from your enabled languages
4. **Fallback language** — if none of the above match, the company's fallback language is used

The customer's preference is saved so it persists across visits — logged-in customers have it stored on their account, while guests have it stored in a cookie.

<Note>
When a customer selects a language that your company does not support, the platform automatically falls back to your company's default language rather than displaying unsupported content.
</Note>

## Language-Specific Domains

You can assign different custom domains to different languages. When a customer visits a language-specific domain, the shop is automatically displayed in that language. This is useful for:

- Running country-specific storefronts (e.g. a `.de` domain for German, a `.fr` domain for French)
- SEO optimisation for different language markets

If a language does not have its own domain, it uses the company's primary domain.

## Translatable Content

Most content fields in the platform support translations. When you have multiple languages enabled, content fields show a language selector allowing you to enter text for each language. If a translation is not provided for a particular language, the fallback language content is displayed instead.

This applies to:

- Event names and descriptions
- Item names and descriptions
- Content blocks
- Data capture questions
- And other text fields throughout the platform

## Admin Panel Language

Admin users can independently select their preferred language for the admin panel. This is stored per user per company, so you can use a different language when working in different companies.

## Email Language

Email communications are sent in the language configured for the relevant context — the customer's selected language for customer-facing emails, or the admin user's language for internal notifications.
