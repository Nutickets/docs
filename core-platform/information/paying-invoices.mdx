## Overview

Invoices are issued for platform fees and services. Outstanding invoices can be viewed and paid directly from the admin panel — either individually or in bulk. Keeping invoices up to date is important, as overdue invoices may lead to restricted account access.

## Invoice Types

There are three types of invoice:

| Type | Description | Payable |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Invoice** | A standard invoice for services or fees | Yes |
| **Proforma Invoice** | A preliminary invoice or estimate issued before final billing | Yes |
| **Credit note** | A deduction applied against previous charges | No |

Credit notes cannot be paid — they represent reductions to your balance and are applied automatically.

## Viewing Invoices

Navigate to the invoices section in the admin panel to see all invoices for your company. The list displays:

- **Reference** — the unique invoice number
- **Date issued** and **Due date**
- **Net**, **VAT**, and **Gross** amounts
- **Status** — whether the invoice has been paid
- **Type** — Invoice, Proforma, or Credit note

### Urgency Indicators

Invoices are colour-coded to help you identify urgency at a glance:

| Colour | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Red** | Overdue — the due date has passed |
| **Amber** | Approaching due date — payment is due soon |
| No highlight | Not yet due |

## Paying Invoices

To pay outstanding invoices:

1. Select the invoices you want to pay using the checkboxes next to each one
2. A **Pay** button appears at the top of the page showing the total amount
3. Click **Pay** to proceed to the payment form
4. Complete the payment

Once payment is successful, the selected invoices are marked as paid.

<Note>
Only invoices and proforma invoices can be selected for payment. Credit notes and already-paid invoices have their checkboxes disabled.
</Note>

### Paying Multiple Invoices

You can select multiple invoices to pay them together in a single transaction. The pay button shows the combined total of all selected invoices.

If you have invoices in multiple currencies, totals are grouped by currency and shown separately — you can only pay invoices in the same currency together.

### Proforma Invoice Settlement

When a proforma invoice is paid, it is automatically converted to a standard invoice with a new reference number. If the invoice PDF was automatically generated, a new PDF is created to reflect the updated type and reference.

## Downloading Invoices

If an invoice has an attached PDF document, a download button appears in the invoice list. Click it to download the invoice file.

## If You Have Questions

If you have questions about a specific invoice or need to dispute a charge, contact your reseller. Invoice details — including the reference number, amounts, and line items — are visible on the invoice detail page.
