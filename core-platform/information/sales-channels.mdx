## Overview

Sales channels determine where each item is available for purchase. By default, items are available on all enabled channels. You can restrict individual items to specific channels — for example, making a VIP upgrade available only at the box office, or offering an online-exclusive early bird ticket.

## Available Channels

The platform supports three sales channels:

| Channel | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Web** | Your online ticket shop, accessible to customers via the event URL |
| **Box office** | The point-of-sale interface used by staff for in-person sales |
| **App** | Self-service kiosk devices where customers can purchase directly |

<Note>
The **App** (kiosk) channel is only available if your company has the kiosk feature enabled. Without it, only **Web** and **Box office** are shown as options.
</Note>

## Configuring Sales Channels

Sales channels are configured per item from the item's pricing settings. Each available channel is shown as a toggle.

To change which channels an item is available on:

1. Open the item's settings
2. In the pricing section, find the sales channel toggles
3. Toggle each channel on or off
4. Save your changes

A help message confirms the effect of your selection:

> This item will only be available for purchase on the sales channels selected above.

<Warning>
If all sales channels are disabled, the item cannot be purchased anywhere. A warning appears: **This item will not be available for purchase until at least one sales channel is enabled.**
</Warning>

## Which Item Types Support Sales Channels

Sales channels can be configured on the following item types:

- Tickets
- Season tickets
- Bundles
- Charity donations
- Resale fees
- Fulfilment fees

Other item types are available across all channels and do not have individual channel controls.

## How Sales Channels Filter Items

When a customer or staff member accesses an event, they only see items enabled for their current channel:

| Context | Channel applied |
|---------|----------------|
| Customer browsing the online shop | **Web** |
| Staff using the box office | **Box office** |
| Customer at a kiosk | **App** |

Items hidden from a channel are completely invisible in that context — they do not appear as sold out or unavailable, they simply do not show.

## Bulk Updates

When editing multiple items at once, sales channel changes can be included in the bulk update. Changes apply only to the channels you explicitly modify — channels you do not touch retain their existing settings across all selected items.

## Resale Sales Channels

Resale items have a separate, simplified sales channel setting that controls where resale listings appear. Rather than per-item toggles, this is a single setting that applies to all resale activity:

| Option | Behaviour |
|--------|-----------|
| **Shop only** | Resale items are only available in the online shop |
| **Shop and box office** | Resale items are available in both the online shop and at the box office |

This is configured in your resale settings rather than on individual items.
