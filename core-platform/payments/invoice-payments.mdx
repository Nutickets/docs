## Overview

Invoice payments (also called manual payments) allow orders to be confirmed without collecting payment at checkout. Instead, the customer receives payment instructions and settles the order outside the platform — for example, by bank transfer. Once payment is received, an admin manually marks the order as complete.

This is useful for:
- Organisations that accept payment by bank transfer, purchase order, or other non-card methods
- Large orders where the buyer needs to arrange payment through their finance department
- Box office sales where payment will be collected later

## Configuring Invoice Payments

Invoice payment settings are managed from **Settings > Payment** in the **Manual payments** section.

### Enabling Invoice Payments

Enable invoice payments separately for each channel:

| Toggle | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Enable in Box Office** | Allows box office staff to create orders using the invoice payment method. Staff can send invoices with payment instructions and account details. |
| **Enable in Shop** | Allows customers to select invoice as a payment method during online checkout. Requires the invoice payments in shop feature to be enabled for your company. |

<Note>
Invoice payments in the shop require a separate feature to be enabled for your company. If you do not see the shop toggle, contact your reseller to enable this capability.
</Note>

### Invoice Payment Settings

Once enabled, configure the following settings:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Enable instant access** | When enabled, customers receive access to tickets and other downloadable items immediately after placing their order, before the invoice is paid. Requires the instant access feature to be enabled for your company. |
| **Unpaid invoice title** | The title displayed on the invoice before it is paid. |
| **Paid invoice title** | The title displayed on the invoice after payment has been confirmed. Acts as a receipt title. |
| **Minimum order value** | The minimum order total required for the invoice payment method to be available. This is a flat rate regardless of currency — no conversion is applied. Only applies to non-box-office checkouts. |
| **Default payment period** | How many days the customer has to pay. This can be changed during box office sales but is fixed for shop checkout. |
| **Payment instructions** | The instructions shown to the customer explaining how to make payment (e.g. bank account details, reference numbers). This is a required field and supports rich text formatting. |
| **Show customer billing address on invoice** | Whether the customer's billing address appears on the generated invoice. |
| **Show customer name and email address on invoice** | Whether the customer's name and email appear on the generated invoice. |

<Note>
The **Default payment period** help text changes depending on which channels are enabled. If both shop and box office are enabled: "This can be changed during box office sales, however is unchangeable for the shop checkout." If only box office is enabled: "This can be changed during box office sales."
</Note>

## Event-Level Overrides

For single-event orders, invoice payment settings can be overridden at the event level. This allows different events to have their own invoice configuration — for example, a different minimum order value or different payment instructions.

Event-level settings are configured from the event's settings page. When an event-level setting is configured, it takes priority over the company-level setting for orders containing items from that event.

<Note>
Manual payments must be enabled at the company level before they can be enabled for an individual event. If manual payments are disabled at the company level, the event-level toggle will show a message: "Manual payments must be enabled at the company level before enabling for an event."
</Note>

## Eligibility Rules

An order is eligible for invoice payment only when **all** of the following conditions are met:

| Condition | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Enabled at company level** | Manual payments must be enabled in company payment settings |
| **Enabled for the context** | If the order contains items from a single event, the event-level setting (if set) or company setting must allow manual payments |
| **Single event only** | The order must contain items from one event only. Multi-event orders cannot use invoice payment. |
| **Channel is allowed** | For shop orders, the invoice-in-shop feature must be enabled and the shop toggle must be on. Box office orders only require the box office toggle. |
| **Not a deposit flow** | Invoice payment is not available for deposit payments or remaining balance payments |
| **Meets minimum value** | The order total must be at or above the configured minimum order value |

If any condition is not met, the invoice payment method does not appear as an option at checkout.

<Note>
If you have multi-event ordering enabled (global basket), a warning in the manual payment settings reminds you that invoice payments will only be available for orders containing a single event.
</Note>

## Customer Checkout Experience

When a customer selects invoice as their payment method in the shop:

1. The checkout displays: "This reservation will require you to make payment via other means. You will be provided with payment details after completing your reservation."
2. If a billing address is required (based on settings), billing address fields appear
3. The customer confirms their order
4. The order is created with status **Awaiting invoice**
5. The customer receives the payment instructions via email

The customer does not need to enter card details — the order is confirmed immediately with payment to follow.

## Invoice Order Lifecycle

After an invoice order is created:

```
1. Order confirmed with invoice payment method
   └── Status: Awaiting invoice
   └── Payment instructions sent to customer
   └── Payment period starts (if configured)

2. Customer pays outside the platform
   └── (Bank transfer, purchase order, etc.)

3. Admin confirms payment received
   └── Status: Complete
   └── Invoice title changes from unpaid title to paid title
```

The admin panel displays a status explanation for invoice orders: "The customer has been provided with payment instructions. Once payment has been received, you will need to manually complete this reservation."

<Note>
If a default payment period is set, the order has an expiry date. If the customer does not pay within the payment period, the order may expire and reserved items will be released. For orders created through the box office, the payment period can be adjusted at the time of sale.
</Note>

## Instant Access

When instant access is enabled, customers receive access to their tickets and other downloadable items immediately after placing their invoice order — without waiting for payment to be confirmed.

This is useful when:
- The event is happening soon and the customer needs their tickets before the payment can be processed
- You trust the customer to pay and want to provide a seamless experience

Instant access requires:
1. The instant access feature must be enabled for your company
2. The **Enable instant access** toggle must be on in manual payment settings
3. Manual payments must be enabled

When instant access is active:
- The order is created without an expiry date (it never expires automatically)
- The customer can immediately access and download their tickets
- The order remains in **Awaiting invoice** status until payment is confirmed

<Note>
In the box office, when instant access is eligible, a message confirms: "This order is eligible for instant access. The customer will have access to tickets & other downloadable items the moment this reservation is complete, before the invoice is paid."
</Note>

## Restrictions

- Invoice payments are only available for **single-event orders** — multi-event baskets cannot use this method
- Invoice payments cannot be combined with **deposit payments** — if a customer has an outstanding deposit balance, invoice is not available
- Invoice payments cannot be used for **split payments** — the full order must be paid by invoice
- The minimum order value is a flat rate across all currencies with no conversion applied
