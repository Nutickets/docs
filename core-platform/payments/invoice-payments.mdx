## Overview

Invoice payments (manual payments) let orders be confirmed without immediate card capture. The order remains payable by invoice/payment instructions.

## Eligibility Rules

An order is eligible only when all of the following are true:

1. Manual payments are enabled at company level.
2. Manual payments are enabled for the event/company context.
3. The order contains items from **one event only**.
4. The channel is allowed (shop requires invoice-in-shop feature + setting).
5. The flow is not deposit or remaining-balance.
6. Order total meets the configured minimum value.

## Event vs Company Settings

For single-event orders, event-level manual payment settings can override company defaults. For multi-event orders, company settings apply.

## Core Settings

| Setting | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `manual_payments_enabled` | Master switch for invoice/manual payments. |
| `manual_payments_enabled_in_shop` | Allows manual payments in customer checkout. |
| `manual_payments_minimum_order_value` | Minimum order total for eligibility. |
| `manual_payments_payment_instructions` | Customer-facing instructions for settlement. |
| `manual_payments_instant_access_enabled` | Allows access before invoice is paid (feature-gated). |

## Instant Access Orders

If enabled and available to the company, manual payment orders can grant customer access immediately while payment is still outstanding.
