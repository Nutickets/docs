title: "Payment Processors"
description: "Connect and configure payment gateways to process card payments and other online payment methods across your ticket shop and box office."
---

## Overview

A payment processor (or gateway) is the external service that authorises and captures electronic payments on your behalf. Before you can accept online payments, you need to connect at least one payment gateway and configure it for the channels where you want to accept payments.

The platform supports over 25 payment gateways. Each gateway connects using credentials from your gateway account, and can be enabled separately for the ticket shop and box office. The gateway you choose affects which payment methods are available to your customers — some gateways offer only standard card payments, while others support local payment methods, in-person terminals, or mobile wallets.

## Connecting a Gateway

To connect a payment gateway:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Payment**
2. Find the gateway you want to connect in the **Payment gateways** section
3. Click the gateway to open its settings
4. Enter your gateway credentials (API keys, merchant IDs, or other details specific to the gateway)
5. Click **Save** — credentials are validated before being stored

Most gateways require separate credentials for test (demo) and live modes, entered on different tabs within the settings modal. A few gateways — Stripe, PayPal, and SumUp — use an OAuth connection flow instead, where you click a connect button and authorise the platform to access your gateway account.

<Note>
Gateway credentials are encrypted before being stored. If you need to disconnect a gateway, you can revoke its credentials from the same settings panel.
</Note>

## Enabling a Gateway per Channel

After connecting a gateway, you choose where it's available:

| Toggle | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Enable in box office** | Makes this gateway available for box office sales |
| **Enable in shop** | Makes this gateway available for ticket shop sales |

A gateway can be enabled in one or both channels. You can also have multiple gateways connected simultaneously — for example, Stripe for the shop and a different gateway for the box office.

## Setting a Primary Gateway

When multiple gateways are enabled for the same channel, you need to designate one as the **primary gateway**. The primary gateway is the default used for processing payments in that channel.

Primary gateways are set independently for each channel:

- **Shop Primary** — the default gateway for ticket shop transactions
- **Box Office Primary** — the default gateway for box office transactions

To set a primary gateway, click **Set primary gateway** on the gateway you want to use as the default for that channel.

<Note>
A gateway must be enabled for a channel before it can be set as the primary for that channel.
</Note>

## Payment Mode (Live vs Demo)

Each company has a payment mode that controls whether transactions use live or test credentials:

| Mode | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| **Live** | Real payments are processed. Money is exchanged. |
| **Demo** | No money is exchanged. Use test card numbers from your gateway's documentation. |

The payment mode toggle is found at the top of **Settings > Payment**. Switching between modes is only available when your account manager allows self-management of payment mode.

<Warning>
Switching from demo to live mode means all subsequent transactions will process real payments. Verify your live credentials are correct before switching.
</Warning>

## How Gateways Process Payments

Not all gateways work the same way. The platform handles four distinct integration patterns, each providing a different checkout experience:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Embedded form">
    The payment form appears directly within your checkout page. The customer enters their card details without leaving your site. The form is rendered by the gateway's JavaScript SDK, so card details are transmitted securely to the gateway without touching your servers.

    **Gateways using this approach:** Stripe, Adyen, Nuvei, Onvo

    This is the smoothest customer experience — no redirects, no page changes. Stripe's Payment Element also supports wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay) and local payment methods within the same embedded form.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Redirect">
    The customer is redirected to the gateway's hosted payment page to enter their card details. After payment, they're redirected back to your site.

    **Gateways using this approach:** QuickPay, PayTabs, Worldpay, DPO Pay, SimplePay, Revolut

    The customer briefly leaves your site, but this approach can be simpler for gateways that don't provide an embeddable SDK.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Form POST">
    The platform generates a hidden form with encrypted payment data and submits it directly to the gateway's endpoint. The gateway processes the payment and redirects the customer back.

    **Gateways using this approach:** Barclays ePDQ, Pay Retailers, Bloomin, Banorte, Transbank

    Similar to redirect from the customer's perspective, but the technical mechanism differs — the form is submitted from your site rather than navigating to a gateway URL.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Server-side API">
    Card details are tokenised client-side (if needed) and the payment is processed entirely via server-to-server API calls. The customer stays on your checkout page throughout.

    **Gateways using this approach:** Authorize.NET, Tap, PowerTranz, Netpay, Curlec, M-Pesa, Hyperpay, SumUp

    For most of these gateways, the customer experience is seamless — they enter card details and the payment processes in the background.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Supported Gateways

The following sections detail each supported gateway, grouped by connection method. Each entry covers the credentials required, any special capabilities, and where the gateway operates.

### OAuth-Connected Gateways

These gateways connect via an authorisation flow — you click a connect button and sign in to your gateway account rather than manually entering API keys.

<Accordion title="Stripe">
  Stripe is the most feature-rich gateway integration on the platform. It uses Stripe's Payment Element for an embedded checkout experience and supports the widest range of payment capabilities.

  **Connection:** Click **Connect with Stripe** to authorise via Stripe Connect. Your Stripe account ID and publishable key are stored automatically.

  **Capabilities:**

  | Feature | Details |
  |---------|---------|
  | **Card payments** | Embedded payment form (Stripe Payment Element) |
  | **Apple Pay & Google Pay** | Supported automatically when your domain is registered — the wallet buttons appear within the payment form |
  | **MOTO payments** | Enable the **MOTO** toggle in gateway settings. Allows box office staff to manually enter card details provided over the phone or by mail. Requires MOTO to be enabled on your Stripe account. |
  | **Terminal payments** | Enable the **Terminal** toggle. Supports physical card readers (e.g. BBPOS WisePOS E) for in-person tap/insert payments. Staff can register, connect, and manage card readers from the box office. |
  | **Saved cards** | Customers can save their card for future checkouts. Saved cards are stored securely by Stripe and shown to returning customers at checkout. |
  | **Local payment methods** | Additional payment methods can be enabled per gateway — for example, **OXXO** (Mexico, MXN only). OXXO generates a voucher the customer pays at a convenience store, with a configurable expiry of 1–7 days. |
  | **Stripe Link** | Stripe's quick-checkout feature that auto-fills saved payment details for returning customers |
  | **Installments** | Supports Mexican card installments (meses sin intereses) where available |
  | **Interac** | Canadian Interac payments supported on terminals when the **Interac** toggle is enabled |
  | **Webhooks** | Payment confirmation is received via webhooks. Webhooks are configured automatically at the platform level. |

  **Additional payment methods available via Stripe:**

  Stripe supports a growing list of local and alternative payment methods that can be enabled from the gateway settings. These include Klarna, Afterpay/Clearpay, Affirm, iDEAL, Bancontact, EPS, Przelewy24 (P24), GrabPay, FPX, Alipay, WeChat Pay, Cash App, and Swish. Each method is currency-restricted — the platform automatically shows only the methods that match the customer's order currency.

  <Note>
  Apple Pay and Google Pay require your shop domain to be registered with Stripe. The platform handles this automatically on first payment, but custom domains may need the Apple Pay domain verification file to be accessible at `/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association`.
  </Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="PayPal">
  PayPal connects via OAuth and provides a PayPal checkout button that customers click to pay through their PayPal account or enter card details on PayPal's hosted pages.

</Note>

## Special Gateway Capabilities

### MOTO Payments

**Mail Order / Telephone Order (MOTO)** payments allow box office staff to process card payments by manually entering card details provided over the phone or by mail. Staff enter the card number, expiry date, and CVV directly into the box office checkout.

MOTO is supported by:
- **Stripe** — enable the **MOTO** toggle in gateway settings
- **Adyen** — enable the **MOTO** toggle in gateway settings
- **Worldpay** — requires separate MOTO credentials (username, password, installation ID, and merchant code)
- **Nuvei** — MOTO is enabled automatically

<Note>
MOTO capability may need to be enabled on your gateway account before it can be used. Contact your payment gateway provider to confirm MOTO is available on your account.
</Note>

### Terminal Payments

Physical card terminal integration allows customers to tap or insert their card at a connected terminal device for in-person payments. Currently, only **Stripe** supports terminal payments through Stripe Terminal.

To set up terminal payments:

1. Enable the **Terminal** toggle in your Stripe gateway settings
2. From the box office, select or register your card reader device
3. Wait for the reader to connect and any firmware updates to apply
4. Process payments by selecting the terminal payment method at checkout

The terminal supports tap (contactless), chip insert, and swipe payments. In Canada, **Interac** debit payments can also be accepted on the terminal when the Interac toggle is enabled.

<Note>
In demo mode, you can use a simulated card reader for testing. Enter a Stripe Terminal test card number to simulate different payment outcomes.
</Note>

### Apple Pay and Google Pay

Apple Pay and Google Pay are supported through **Stripe** and appear as wallet payment options within the embedded payment form when available. Customers using a supported device and browser see the wallet buttons alongside the standard card entry fields.

**Hyperpay** also supports Apple Pay and Google Pay, configured per entity within the gateway settings.

Your shop domain must be registered for wallet payments to work. The platform handles Stripe domain registration automatically. For Apple Pay specifically, the domain verification file must be accessible at `/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association` — this is served automatically for standard setups, but custom domains may need additional configuration. You can upload a custom Apple Pay verification certificate from **Settings > Payment** under **Apple Pay domains**.

### Local Payment Methods

Several gateways support region-specific payment methods beyond standard cards:

| Gateway | Local methods | Region |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| **Stripe** | OXXO, Klarna, Afterpay/Clearpay, Affirm, iDEAL, Bancontact, EPS, P24, GrabPay, FPX, Alipay, WeChat Pay, Cash App, Swish | Global (currency-dependent) |
| **Pay Retailers** | Cash payments, online bank transfers | Latin America |
| **M-Pesa** | Mobile money transfer | East Africa |
| **SimplePay** | SZEP cards (employee benefit) | Hungary |

Local payment methods on Stripe are enabled from the gateway settings under **Payment method types**. Each method is currency-restricted — for example, OXXO only appears for MXN transactions, iDEAL only for EUR. The platform automatically filters which methods are shown at checkout based on the order currency.

<Note>
OXXO payments are asynchronous — the customer receives a voucher to pay at a convenience store. The order moves to **Awaiting local payment** status until the payment is confirmed via webhook. The voucher expiry can be configured from 1 to 7 days (default: 3 days).
</Note>

### Saved Cards

**Stripe** is currently the only gateway that supports saved cards. When a customer checks the **Save this card for future checkouts** option during payment, their card details are securely stored by Stripe. On subsequent checkouts, the customer sees their saved cards and can select one rather than re-entering card details.

Saved cards are stored per customer. The platform creates a Stripe Customer object for each customer who saves a card, linking their saved payment methods to their account.

## Platform-Managed Gateways

In some configurations, your account manager may manage gateway credentials on your behalf. When this is the case:

- The account manager connects the gateway at the platform level
- Your company uses the platform credentials for processing
- You may not see credential fields or payment mode toggles in your settings

Gateways that support platform-level management include **Stripe**, **SumUp**, **PayPal**, **Ryft**, **Curlec**, and **Nuvei**.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues when configuring gateways:

| Problem | Likely cause |
|---------|-------------|
| Credentials rejected when saving | Invalid API key, merchant ID, or secret. Double-check values from your gateway dashboard. |
| Gateway enabled but payments fail | Payment mode mismatch — live credentials in demo mode (or vice versa). |
| Gateway not appearing in checkout | Gateway is connected but not enabled for the relevant channel (shop or box office). |
| Billing address errors at checkout | A gateway that requires billing address is enabled but the checkout form is not collecting it. This is handled automatically, but custom checkout implementations may need updating. |
| Wallet payments (Apple/Google Pay) not appearing | Domain not registered — this usually resolves automatically on first payment attempt. Check that the Apple Pay verification file is accessible for custom domains. |
| MOTO option not available in box office | MOTO toggle not enabled in gateway settings, or MOTO not enabled on your gateway account. |
| Terminal reader not connecting | Ensure the reader is powered on, connected to the internet, and up to date with firmware. Try reconnecting from the box office. |
