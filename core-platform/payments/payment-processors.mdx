## Overview

A payment processor (or gateway) is the external service that authorises and captures electronic payments on your behalf. Before you can accept online payments, you need to connect at least one payment gateway and configure it for the channels where you want to accept payments.

The platform supports over 25 payment gateways. Each gateway is connected using credentials from your gateway account, and can be enabled separately for the ticket shop and box office.

## Supported Gateways

The following payment gateways are available:

| Gateway | Notable capabilities |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Stripe** | Terminal support, MOTO payments |
| **PayPal** | — |
| **Adyen** | MOTO payments |

</Note>

## Connecting a Gateway

To connect a payment gateway:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Payment**
2. Find the gateway you want to connect in the **Payment gateways** section
3. Click the gateway to open its settings
4. Enter your gateway credentials (API keys, merchant IDs, or other details specific to the gateway)
5. Click **Save** — credentials are validated before being stored

Each gateway has its own credential requirements. Refer to your gateway provider's documentation for the specific keys and identifiers you need.

<Note>
Gateway credentials are encrypted before being stored. If you need to disconnect a gateway, you can revoke its credentials from the same settings panel.
</Note>

## Enabling a Gateway per Channel

After connecting a gateway, you choose where it's available:

| Toggle | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Enable in box office** | Makes this gateway available for box office sales |
| **Enable in shop** | Makes this gateway available for ticket shop sales |

A gateway can be enabled in one or both channels. You can also have multiple gateways connected simultaneously — for example, Stripe for the shop and a different gateway for the box office.

## Setting a Primary Gateway

When multiple gateways are enabled for the same channel, you need to designate one as the **primary gateway**. The primary gateway is the default used for processing payments in that channel.

Primary gateways are set independently for each channel:

- **Shop Primary** — the default gateway for ticket shop transactions
- **Box Office Primary** — the default gateway for box office transactions

To set a primary gateway, click **Set primary gateway** on the gateway you want to use as the default for that channel.

<Note>
A gateway must be enabled for a channel before it can be set as the primary for that channel.
</Note>

## Payment Mode (Live vs Test)

Each company has a payment mode that controls whether transactions use live or test credentials:

| Mode | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| **Live** | Real payments are processed. Money is exchanged. |
| **Demo** | No money is exchanged. Use test card numbers from your gateway's documentation. |

The payment mode toggle is found at the top of **Settings > Payment**. Switching between modes is only available when your reseller allows self-management of payment mode.

<Warning>
Switching from demo to live mode means all subsequent transactions will process real payments. Verify your live credentials are correct before switching.
</Warning>

## Special Gateway Capabilities

### MOTO Payments

**Mail Order / Telephone Order (MOTO)** payments allow box office staff to process card payments by manually entering card details provided over the phone or by mail. This is supported by **Stripe** and **Adyen**.

MOTO capability may need to be enabled on your gateway account — contact your payment gateway account manager to confirm MOTO is available.

### Terminal Payments

**Stripe** supports physical card terminal integration, allowing customers to tap or insert their card at a connected terminal device for in-person payments.

## Reseller-Managed Gateways

In some configurations, your reseller may manage gateway credentials on your behalf. When this is the case:

- The reseller connects the gateway at the platform level
- Your company uses the reseller's credentials for processing
- You may not see credential fields or payment mode toggles in your settings

Gateways that support reseller-level management include Stripe, SumUp, PayPal, Ryft, Curlec, and Nuvei.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues when configuring gateways:

| Problem | Likely cause |
|---------|-------------|
| Credentials rejected when saving | Invalid API key, merchant ID, or secret. Double-check values from your gateway dashboard. |
| Gateway enabled but payments fail | Payment mode mismatch — live credentials in demo mode (or vice versa). |
| Gateway not appearing in checkout | Gateway is connected but not enabled for the relevant channel (shop or box office). |
| Billing address errors at checkout | A gateway that requires billing address is enabled but the checkout form is not collecting it. This is handled automatically, but custom checkout implementations may need updating. |
