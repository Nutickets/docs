## Overview

A payment processor (gateway) is the service that authorizes and captures electronic payments. The platform supports multiple gateways, with credentials and availability determined by reseller/company setup.

## Gateway Configuration Model

| Level | Typical responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Reseller** | Can configure reseller-level credentials for supported gateways. |
| **Company** | Can use reseller credentials or company-specific credentials depending on gateway rules and permissions. |
| **Checkout channel** | Shop and box office can expose different method sets even when using the same gateway. |

## Key Behaviors

- Gateway credentials are validated before saving.
- Companies can toggle payment mode (live/test) only when reseller policy allows self-management.
- A company can have multiple gateways enabled and can set a primary/default gateway.
- Some payment methods are gateway-agnostic/offline and do not call an external processor.

## Practical Setup Flow

1. Enable/configure gateway credentials in Hub or Admin (depending on ownership model).
2. Verify channel-level methods in payment settings.
3. Confirm live/test mode.
4. Run a test transaction in the target channel.

## Common Failure Sources

- Missing or invalid credentials.
- Live mode enabled with test credentials (or vice versa).
- Channel method enabled but gateway unavailable for that method.
- Parent/child payment ownership mismatch when global transaction settings are used.
