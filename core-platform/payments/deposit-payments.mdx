## Overview

Deposit payments allow customers to confirm an order by paying only part of the total up front, then settle the remaining balance later.

## How It Works

1. A deposit payment plan is selected for the checkout.
2. The system calculates **total due today**.
3. The order is created with an outstanding balance.
4. Remaining balance is collected later using a remaining-balance payment context.

## Calculation Behavior

- If deposit mode is active and order is eligible, due-today uses the generated deposit amount.
- Tax for deposit payments is proportioned relative to the amount collected now.
- For later payments, unpaid tax is used to prevent over-allocation.

## Important Constraints

- Manual invoice payment methods are not available during deposit or remaining-balance payment flows.
- Split payments can still be used for the amount due today where enabled.

## Operational Guidance

- Keep customer comms clear on due dates and outstanding balance.
- Monitor orders in awaiting-payment style statuses until final settlement.
- Test gateway and reminder behavior for both deposit and balance payment stages.
