## Overview

Split payments let one order be paid by multiple methods. Each split includes:

- `payment_method`
- `amount`

The platform validates both structure and total before processing.

## Validation Rules

- Every split must contain a valid method key and numeric amount.
- The sum of split amounts must match the expected amount due today.
- Split mode is only treated as split mode when there is more than one valid split.

## Default Split Generation

When eligible, the system can pre-build splits for scenarios such as:

- **Balance on hand** used first.
- **Resale seller contribution** applied when relevant.
- **Wallet balance spending** when enabled/encouraged.
- **Gateway/card remainder** for any outstanding amount.

## Gateway Portion in Split Flows

In split mode, the platform identifies the online/gateway split and processes that portion through the selected gateway while preserving the other split records.

## Tax and Fee Allocation

For split payments, tax, reseller fee, and processing fee are proportioned against the relevant split amount to keep totals consistent.

## Typical Use Cases

- Part wallet + part card payment.
- Box office order modification with mixed methods.
- Resale transactions where seller contribution offsets part of buyer payment.
