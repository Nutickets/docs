## Overview

Payments in the platform are built from three layers:

- **Order state**: what is currently due (full payment, deposit, remaining balance, invoice, or approval flow).
- **Allowed payment methods**: what the company/reseller has enabled for this channel.
- **Gateway processing**: where card or local payment requests are actually sent.

Payment behavior can differ between **shop** and **box office**, and can also differ by company in parent/child setups where global transaction settings are enabled.

## Core Concepts

| Concept | What it controls |
|---|---|
| **Payment mode (live/test)** | Whether a company uses live credentials or test/sandbox credentials (if self-management is enabled). |
| **Payment company** | The company that owns payment configuration and receives funds for the order. |
| **Manual payments (invoice)** | Deferred payment flow that can be enabled globally and optionally in shop. |
| **Split payments** | Paying one order with multiple methods in the same checkout flow. |
| **Deposit plan** | Taking an initial payment now and collecting the remainder later. |

## Where Configuration Lives

- `Settings > Payment` in admin controls gateway settings, checkout behavior, and invoice/manual payment settings.
- Resellers can provide or manage gateway credentials in Hub, depending on gateway and reseller setup.
- Some controls are feature-gated and only appear when enabled for the company/reseller.
