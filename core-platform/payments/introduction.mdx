## Overview

Payments control how customers pay for orders placed through your ticket shop or box office. The platform supports a range of payment methods — from online card payments through a gateway, to offline methods like cash and bank transfer, to deferred flows where payment is collected after the order is placed.

Payment behaviour is shaped by three things:

- **What the customer owes** — whether they're paying the full amount, a deposit, or a remaining balance
- **Which payment methods are available** — determined by your gateway configuration and channel settings
- **How the payment is processed** — through an online gateway, recorded offline, or deferred for later collection

## Channels

Payments can work differently depending on where the sale happens:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Ticket Shop">
    The customer-facing online checkout. Payment methods here are typically gateway-based (card payments, local payment methods). Invoice payments and account balance spending can also be enabled for the shop.

    The checkout flow adapts dynamically based on basket content — additional steps may appear for data capture, VAT details, gift aid, or charity donations depending on configuration.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Box Office">
    The staff-facing sales interface. Box office supports all online methods plus in-person methods like cash, cheque, bank transfer, and external card terminals. Staff can also generate payment links, create invoice reservations, and reserve orders for on-site payment.

    Box office includes additional controls for customer assignment, confirmation emails, and payment method metadata (e.g. cheque numbers, card network details).

## Payment Methods

The platform supports a wide range of payment methods, broadly grouped by how they're processed:

| Category | Methods |
|----------|---------|
| **Online gateway** | Card payments, MOTO transactions, local payment methods (e.g. OXXO) |
| **Offline** | Cash, bank transfer, cheque, money order, external card terminal |
| **Account balance** | Customer account balance (e-wallet), balance carried forward from a previous order |
| **Deferred** | Payment link, invoice, reserve to pay on-site, pending approval |
| **Other** | Complimentary, gift card, split payment (multiple methods on one order) |

Not all methods are available in every context. Gateway-based methods require a configured payment processor, some methods are box office only, and certain methods (like invoice or account balance) require specific settings or feature access to be enabled.

## Payment Company

Every order is processed through a **payment company** — the company whose payment configuration and gateway credentials are used for the transaction.

In most setups, this is simply the company running the event. In parent/child company structures where global transaction settings are enabled, the parent company may handle payment processing on behalf of child companies.

## Where to Configure Payments

Payment configuration is managed from **Settings > Payment** in the admin panel. This page is organised into sections:

| Section | What it controls |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Payment gateways** | Connect and configure payment processors, set primary gateways per channel, toggle live/test mode |
| **Manual payments** | Enable invoice payments, set minimum order values, configure payment instructions |
| **Deposit payments** | Set deposit percentages, minimum order values, and payment deadlines |
| **Checkout settings** | Payment link expiry, confirmation email toggles, box office payment metadata requirements |
| **Balance settings** | Account balance spending, top-ups, cashouts, and balance refund controls |

Some settings sections are only visible when the relevant feature is enabled for your company.
