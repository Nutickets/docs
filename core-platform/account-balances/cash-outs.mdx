## Overview

- Cash-outs return wallet balance value back to the customer through refund processing.
- Cash-outs can be initiated by staff (admin) or by customers (shop) depending on company settings.
- The platform validates that the requested amount is refundable and available.

## Validation Rules

Cash-out processing checks:

- account-balance feature access
- wallet ownership and permission model
- company wallet cash-out setting (`cashouts_enabled`)
- refundable source value from eligible top-up order items
- current wallet balance ceiling

## Online vs Offline Scope

| Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Online | Restricts source top-ups to online payment transactions. |
| Offline/Admin | Supports wider payment method sets based on operator action. |

## Important Behaviour

- If amount is omitted in some staff workflows, the system derives a safe maximum.
- Cash-out requests that exceed refundable value or available balance are rejected.
- Cash-outs are executed through refund actions, preserving financial auditability.
