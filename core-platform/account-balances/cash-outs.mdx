## Overview

Cash outs allow customers (or staff on their behalf) to withdraw funds from an account balance back to the original payment method. Unlike a standard refund, a cash out specifically targets the balance that was loaded through [top-up purchases](/core-platform/account-balances/top-ups) — the system traces each top up back to its originating order and processes refunds against those transactions.

This means the refundable amount is not simply the current balance — it is limited to the value of unspent top ups that were paid for through eligible payment methods.

## How Cash Outs Work

When a cash out is processed, the system:

1. Identifies the customer's top-up order items that are eligible for refund
2. Filters them by payment method type (online or offline — see [Online vs Offline](#online-vs-offline) below)
3. Allocates the requested cash-out amount across those top-up items
4. Processes a refund for each originating order, returning money to the original payment method
5. Deducts the cashed-out amount from the customer's account balance

The customer's balance decreases and the funds are returned through the same payment channel they originally used to purchase the top ups.

<Note>
Cash outs are processed as refunds against the original top-up orders. This means the money goes back to the payment method the customer used when buying the top up — not to a bank account or other destination chosen at cash-out time.
</Note>

## Enabling Cash Outs

Cash outs require two things to be enabled:

1. The **Account Balances** feature must be active for your company
2. The **Enable online cash outs** setting must be turned on in **Settings > Payment Settings > Balance settings**

Once enabled, customers can initiate cash outs from their account page in the ticket shop, and admin staff can process cash outs from a customer's wallet page.

## Online vs Offline

Cash outs distinguish between two types based on how the original top ups were paid for:

| Type | Refunds to | When to use |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Online** | Payment methods used for online top-up purchases (card payments, etc.) | Customer-initiated cash outs from the ticket shop |
| **Offline** | A wider set of payment methods including those used for in-person top-up purchases | Admin-initiated cash outs from the admin panel |

The **refundable balance** shown for each type may differ because each only considers top ups paid through its respective payment method set. A customer who loaded £50 online and £30 via box office would see a different refundable balance for online vs offline cash outs.

## Customer-Initiated Cash Outs

When cash outs are enabled, customers can withdraw funds from their account page in the ticket shop:

1. The customer navigates to their account page
2. They click **Cash out** on their balance card
3. The system calculates the maximum refundable amount based on their online top-up history
4. The refund is processed against the original top-up orders

Customer-initiated cash outs always use the **online** type, meaning only top ups purchased through online payment methods are eligible.

<Note>
The **Cash out** button is disabled when the customer's balance is zero. A tooltip message explains: the balance must be greater than zero to cash out.
</Note>

## Admin-Initiated Cash Outs

Staff can process cash outs on behalf of a customer from the admin panel:

1. Navigate to **Customers** and find the customer
2. Open their **Account Balance** page
3. Click **Cash Out** in the quick actions
4. Select the cash-out type:
   - **Online** — refunds top ups paid via online payment methods
   - **Offline** — refunds top ups paid via any payment method (broader eligibility)
5. Review the **refundable balance** shown for the selected type
6. Review the **current balance** and **balance after cash out**
7. Click **Submit** to process the cash out

<Note>
Admin cash outs require the **cashout wallet transactions** permission. The cash-out panel shows the refundable balance for the selected type — this is the maximum amount that can be cashed out, not the full wallet balance.
</Note>

## Refundable Balance

The refundable balance is not the same as the current wallet balance. It is calculated as:

> The total value of unspent, unexpired top-up order items paid through eligible payment methods — capped at the current wallet balance.

This means:

- **Only top-up purchases count** — balance added through manual adjustments, complimentary credits, gift vouchers, or transfer-ins is not refundable via cash out
- **Already-refunded top ups are excluded** — if a top up has already been partially or fully refunded, only the remaining unrefunded portion counts
- **Expired top ups are excluded** — if a cashout expiry is configured and the top up has passed its expiry window, it is no longer eligible
- **The current balance is the ceiling** — even if eligible top ups total more than the current balance (because the customer has spent some of it), the refundable amount cannot exceed what is actually in the wallet

## Cashout Expiry

You can set an expiry window on top-up cashout eligibility in **Settings > Payment Settings > Balance settings** under **Account balance cashout topup expiry**.

- After the configured time has elapsed since purchase, a top up can no longer be cashed out
- If set to zero, top ups remain eligible for cash out indefinitely
- The expiry only applies to top ups purchased after the setting is configured — it is not applied retroactively

<Note>
The cashout expiry setting only appears when **Enable online cash outs** is turned on.
</Note>

## Validation Rules

Cash outs are rejected if any of the following conditions apply:

| Condition | What happens |
|-----------|-------------|
| Cash-out amount is zero | The system does not process zero-amount cash outs |
| Amount exceeds refundable balance | The requested amount is more than the refundable balance for the selected type (online or offline) |
| Amount exceeds total unspent top ups | The requested amount is more than the total value of all unspent top ups, regardless of current balance |
| Balance is zero | The cash-out button is disabled — there is nothing to cash out |

## Transaction Recording

Each cash out creates transaction records in the customer's wallet history:

- **Online cash out** — for cash outs of online top-up purchases
- **Offline cash out** — for cash outs of offline top-up purchases

The corresponding top-up order items are updated to reflect the refunded amounts, maintaining a full audit trail from purchase through to cash out.
