## Overview

- Top ups are sale items that add value to a customer wallet.
- They are managed from wallet top-up screens in admin and sold through enabled sales channels.
- Top-up sale items use dedicated item type behaviour (`wallet_topup`) and company-scoped inventories.

## Configuration

| Area | Notes |
|---|---|
| Pricing | Currency-specific top-up amounts and pricing records |
| Sales channels | Ticket shop and box office channel support |
| Tax | Uses normal sale item tax-band assignment where configured |
| Availability | Top ups are treated as always-stocked (`has_unlimited_stock`) |

## Operational Notes

- Wallet features are only available when account-balance features are enabled for the company.
- Top-up creation and editing are permission-controlled.
- Top-up sale items appear in wallet reporting and transaction history.
