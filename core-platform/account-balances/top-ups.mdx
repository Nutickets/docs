## Overview

Top ups allow customers to load funds onto their account balance, which they can then spend on future purchases. Customers purchase top-up items just like any other sale item — through the ticket shop or box office — and the funds are credited to their balance once the order is complete.

Top ups are managed as sale items in the admin panel. You can offer fixed-amount top ups (e.g. £10, £25, £50) or variable-price top ups where customers choose their own amount. Each top-up item can be configured with its own pricing, sales channels, and tax settings.

<Note>
Top ups require the **Account Balances** feature to be enabled for your company, and the **Enable online top ups** setting must be turned on in **Settings > Payment Settings > Balance settings**.
</Note>

## Creating a Top Up

To create a new top-up sale item:

1. Navigate to **Account Balances > Top Ups**
2. Click **Create topup**
3. Configure the top-up item (see [Configuration](#configuration) below)
4. Click **Save**

The top-up item becomes available for purchase through the sales channels you select.

## Configuration

### Pricing

Top ups support two pricing models:

| Model | How it works |
|-------|-------------|
| **Fixed price** | Customers purchase a set amount (e.g. £10 top up for £10). Set a specific price per currency. |
| **Variable price** | Customers enter their own amount at purchase time. You set a minimum amount (starting from £0.01). |

Pricing is configured per currency — if your company operates in multiple currencies, you set pricing for each one independently.

<Note>
Top-up items cannot be free. Every top-up must have a price or a minimum variable price of at least £0.01.
</Note>

### Sales Channels

Top ups can be sold through:

- **Ticket shop** — customers purchase top ups from their account page or during checkout
- **Box office** — staff sell top ups on behalf of customers

Control visibility with the **Hide from shop** and **Hide from box office** toggles when editing a top-up item.

### Tax

Top ups use standard tax band assignment. If your company has tax bands configured, you can assign one to a top-up item just like any other sale item.

### Fees

Top-up items support fee configuration. Fees can be:

- **Fixed** — a flat fee added to each top up
- **Percentage-based** — a percentage of the top-up amount
- **Minimum/Maximum** — bounds on the fee amount

The fee display depends on your company's fee absorption settings — fees may be shown separately or included in the displayed price.

### Availability

You can control when top ups are available for purchase using:

- **On sale from** — the date and time the top up becomes available
- **On sale until** — the date and time the top up stops being available

Top-up items always have unlimited stock — they never sell out.

## How Customers Purchase Top Ups

### From the Account Page

Customers can top up their balance from the **Account** section of the ticket shop:

1. The customer navigates to their account page
2. They click **Top up** on their balance card
3. A modal opens showing their **current balance** and projected **balance after top up**
4. They select a top-up package (or enter a custom amount for variable-price top ups)
5. The top-up item is added to their basket and they proceed to checkout
6. Once the order is complete, the funds are credited to their account balance

<Note>
If your company supports multiple currencies, customers only see top-up options that match their current wallet currency.
</Note>

### During Checkout

If balance spending is enabled, a top-up card appears in the checkout sidebar showing:

- **Current balance** (if the customer has no top ups in the basket)
- **Balance after checkout** (if the customer has added top ups to their basket)

Customers can click **Add top up** to add a top-up item to their current order.

## How Top Ups Are Credited

When a customer completes an order containing a top-up item, the funds are automatically credited to their account balance. The top-up amount is recorded as a transaction on the customer's wallet — either as an **Online top up** or **Offline top up** depending on the payment method used.

Each top-up item can only be claimed once. If an order contains multiple top-up items, each is credited individually.

<Note>
Top ups are only credited when the order reaches **Complete** status. If an order is pending or cancelled, the top-up funds are not added to the customer's balance.
</Note>

## Claiming Gift Vouchers

Customers can also add funds to their account balance by redeeming gift vouchers. This is a separate flow from purchasing top ups, but the result is the same — funds are credited to the customer's wallet.

To claim a gift voucher:

1. The customer clicks **Claim gift voucher** on their account page
2. They enter the voucher code
3. The system validates the code and shows the voucher amount
4. The customer clicks **Redeem** to add the funds to their balance

The transaction appears in their history as **Claimed gift voucher**.

<Warning>
Once redeemed, the full balance associated with a gift voucher is assigned to the customer. Gift vouchers cannot be reused or split between accounts. The voucher's currency must match the customer's account balance currency.
</Warning>

<Note>
Gift voucher claiming requires the **Gift Vouchers** feature to be enabled for your company. If balance spending in shop is not enabled, customers will not be able to spend their claimed balance — a warning is shown to admins when this situation is detected.
</Note>

## Managing Top Ups in Admin

### Viewing Top Ups

Navigate to **Account Balances > Top Ups** to see all top-up sale items. The list shows each top-up item with its name, pricing, and availability status.

### Editing a Top Up

Click on any top-up item to edit its configuration. You can update pricing, sales channels, tax bands, and availability dates. Changes take effect immediately for future purchases.

### Top Up Transactions

When a customer purchases a top up, it appears in the admin **Account Balances > Transactions** list. Each top-up transaction shows:

- The customer who purchased it
- The amount credited
- The transaction type (**Online top up** or **Offline top up**)
- The date and time

You can also view a specific customer's top-up history from their wallet page at **Customers > [Customer] > Account Balance**.

For programmatic access to wallet data, use the API to [retrieve wallets](/api-reference/wallets/retrieve-wallets), [retrieve a specific wallet](/api-reference/wallets/retrieve-a-wallet), or [list wallet transactions](/api-reference/wallets/retrieve-wallet-transactions).

## Cashout Expiry

If **Enable online cash outs** is turned on, you can set an **Account balance cashout topup expiry** time. After this period, top ups purchased by a customer can no longer be cashed out (refunded back to the original payment method).

- If set to zero, top ups remain cashable out indefinitely
- This only applies to newly purchased top ups — it cannot be applied retroactively to past purchases

For more on cash outs, see [Cash Outs](/core-platform/account-balances/cash-outs).
