## Overview

Pricing display settings determine how prices are shown and interpreted in the platform.

## Primary Controls

| Setting | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Price display** | Controls tax-inclusive vs tax-exclusive display behavior where supported. |
| **Price input** | Controls whether entered prices are treated as including tax or excluding tax. |

## Important Constraints

Some combinations are blocked when specific pricing-display features are enabled. Validate display/input strategy before rolling out large pricing changes.

## Customer Impact Areas

- Event and item pricing presentation.
- Checkout totals and line-item interpretation.
