## Overview

Tax bands define named tax rates (e.g. "VAT 20%", "No Tax") that are applied to sale items and fees across the platform. When a tax band is assigned to a sale item, the system calculates tax on every purchase of that item and sends a separate tax receipt email to the customer alongside the standard order confirmation.

Tax bands are managed from **Settings > Tax bands** in the admin area. They are the foundation of all tax-related functionality — [conditional tax bands](/core-platform/tax/conditional-tax-bands), [pricing display](/core-platform/tax/pricing-display), and [advanced tax settings](/core-platform/tax/advanced-tax-settings) all build on top of them.

## Creating a Tax Band

1. Navigate to **Settings > Tax bands**.
2. Click **Add new tax band**.
3. Enter the following:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | A descriptive name for the tax band (e.g. "Standard VAT", "Zero Rated"). This is visible when assigning tax bands to sale items. |
| **Rate** | The tax percentage to apply. Supports up to 4 decimal places for precision (e.g. `21.5` or `7.7000`). |

4. Click **Submit** to save.

<Note>
If you attach a tax band to a sale item, a separate tax invoice email will be sent as well as the standard order confirmation email. You can set your company billing details that will appear on these invoices from **Company Settings**.
</Note>

## Assigning Tax Bands to Sale Items

Once created, tax bands can be assigned to individual sale items during item setup. In the sale item editor, select a tax band from the **Tax Band** dropdown. This determines the tax rate applied to purchases of that item.

Each sale item can either use:
- A **Single tax band** — one fixed rate for all customers.
- **Multiple conditional tax bands** — different rates based on the customer's country. See [Conditional Tax Bands](/core-platform/tax/conditional-tax-bands) for details.

## Editing a Tax Band

1. Navigate to **Settings > Tax bands**.
2. Click on the tax band you want to edit.
3. Update the **Name** or **Rate** as needed.
4. Click **Submit** to save your changes.

<Note>
Changing a tax band's rate affects all future orders for sale items that use it. Existing completed orders retain the rate that was in effect at the time of purchase.
</Note>

## Deleting a Tax Band

Tax bands can be deleted from the tax bands list using the delete button next to each entry.

A tax band **cannot be deleted** while it is in use by:
- Any sale item (as its assigned tax band)
- Any conditional tax band mapping

If you attempt to delete a tax band that is in use, the system displays the message: *"This tax band cannot be deleted whilst it is in use."* Remove the tax band from all sale items and conditional mappings first, then delete it.

<Note>
Tax bands are soft-deleted, meaning they can be restored after deletion if needed.
</Note>

## Default Tax Band

The system includes a default tax band (the first tax band created) that cannot be deleted. This ensures there is always at least one tax band available in the system.

## Tax Receipts

When a sale item has a tax band assigned, the platform automatically sends a tax receipt email to the customer after a successful purchase. This email is separate from the order confirmation and includes a breakdown of the tax applied.

Tax receipt emails can be disabled from company settings if you handle tax receipts externally. See [Advanced Tax Settings](/core-platform/tax/advanced-tax-settings) for details.

## Company Default Tax Band

A default tax band can be set at the company level from **Company Settings** under **Default tax band**. This determines the tax rate applied to any invoices generated for the company. If left blank, no sales tax information appears on company invoices.

## Where Tax Bands Appear

Tax bands are referenced throughout the platform:

- **Sale item configuration** — selecting which tax rate applies to an item
- **Checkout** — calculating the tax component of a customer's order
- **Order details** — displaying the tax breakdown for an order
- **Tax receipt emails** — itemised tax invoices sent to customers
- **Reporting** — gross, net, and tax breakdowns in reports
- **Company invoices** — tax applied to company-level billing
