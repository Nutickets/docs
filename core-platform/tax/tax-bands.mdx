## Overview

Tax bands define named tax rates used across sale items and fee items.

## Core Operations

- Create tax band (`name`, `rate`).
- Edit tax band details.
- Soft-delete and restore.

## Safety Rules

A tax band cannot be deleted while it is in use by:

- sale items (`tax_band_id`), or
- conditional sale-item tax mappings.

## Scope

Tax bands are available in admin and hub contexts, with visibility constrained by current scope and permissions.
