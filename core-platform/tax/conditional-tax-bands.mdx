## Overview

Conditional tax bands let you vary tax treatment based on customer country groupings.

## Building Blocks

1. **Country classifications**: named sets/rules of countries.
2. **Conditional mappings**: attach classification-aware tax behavior to items/fees where supported.

## Country Classifications

You can create, edit, and delete classifications with:

- name
- matching mode
- country selections

Classifications include usage counts and are scoped by company visibility rules.

## Where Used

Conditional tax options are exposed in fee/sale-item editors when the corresponding feature is enabled.
