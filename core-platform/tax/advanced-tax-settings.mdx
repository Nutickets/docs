## Overview

Advanced tax behavior extends beyond assigning a single tax band. It includes calculation strategy, country-aware logic, and external integration constraints.

## Typical Advanced Controls

- Conditional tax band behavior by country classification.
- Tax calculation option selection (where available).
- Integration compatibility checks (for example tax precision limits required by specific providers).

## Operational Checklist

1. Confirm base tax bands are complete.
2. Confirm country classifications are accurate.
3. Test checkout in primary currencies and key customer geographies.
4. Validate downstream exports/invoices for expected tax values.
