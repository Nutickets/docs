## Overview

Box office mode lets staff sell tickets, products, and other items directly to customers — in person, over the phone, or on behalf of a third party. It runs inside the same ticket shop that customers use online, but with additional tools designed for staff-assisted sales: manual payment methods, customer lookup, staff discounts, validation overrides, and post-sale actions like quick sell and printing.

When a staff member launches box office mode from the admin panel, a secure session is created in the ticket shop. The staff member browses events, adds items to a basket, assigns a customer (or sells without one), and completes the order using any available payment method — including cash, cheque, card terminal, and invoice.

This is useful for:

- Walk-up ticket sales at venue box offices or kiosks
- Phone orders taken by customer service staff
- Processing orders on behalf of customers who need assistance
- Selling to customers who don't have an online account

## How It Works

Box office mode operates as a session within the ticket shop. The session bridges the admin panel and the shop:

| Stage | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **Launch** | A staff member clicks **Sell event** or **Enter box office** in the admin panel. A time-limited signed URL authenticates them into the shop. |
| **Browse & select** | The staff member navigates the shop, selects events, and adds items to a basket — the same way a customer would online. |
| **Checkout** | The checkout flow includes additional box office steps: customer assignment, order source selection, and an expanded set of payment methods. |
| **Complete** | After payment, the staff member can print tickets, quick sell the same items to another customer, or start a new order. |

The staff member's admin user account is temporarily authenticated in the shop. If they don't assign a specific customer to the order, items are purchased under their own account.

## Key Differences from the Public Shop

| Area | Public Shop | Box Office |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Who checks out** | The customer | A staff member, optionally on behalf of a customer |
| **Customer assignment** | Automatic (logged-in user) | Configurable — full customer, name only, or no customer |
| **Payment methods** | Online payments (card, e-wallet) | Expanded: cash, cheque, card terminal, MOTO, invoice, complimentary, plus online methods |
| **Billing address** | Collected during checkout | Automatically skipped |
| **Confirmation emails** | Always sent | Can be [disabled in settings](/core-platform/box-office/checkout-flow#confirmation-emails) |
| **Order source** | Website | Selectable: **Counter**, **Telephone**, or **Third Party** |
| **Discounts** | Customer-facing codes only | Staff discounts, external vouchers, and customer-facing codes |
| **Validation rules** | Fully enforced | Can be [selectively bypassed](/core-platform/box-office/discounts-and-overrides#validation-bypass-permissions) with appropriate permissions |
| **Instant checkout** | Not available | [Side panel](/core-platform/box-office/instant-checkout) for rapid transactions |
| **Post-sale actions** | Limited | Quick sell, reserve same items, print, transfer, rename, refund |

## Permissions

Box office access is controlled by role-based permissions:

| Permission | What It Allows |
|------------|----------------|
| **Sell items** | Required to access box office mode. Can be scoped to specific events. |
| **Enter box office** | Allows launching box office from the admin panel |
| **Sell in box office** | Allows selling items through box office mode |
| **Box office: Can apply custom discounts** | Apply manual staff discounts during checkout |
| **Box office: Can apply external vouchers** | Apply external voucher codes during checkout |
| **Ignore box office validation** permissions | Override specific checkout validations (see [Discounts and Overrides](/core-platform/box-office/discounts-and-overrides#validation-bypass-permissions)) |

<Note>
If a user has the **Sell items** permission on specific events rather than globally, they can only access box office for those events.
</Note>

## Company Settings

Box office behaviour is configured through company settings. These are the key settings — specific pages cover each in more detail.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Enable box office guest checkout** | Controls whether staff must assign a customer to orders. Three modes: guest checkout allowed, name only required, or full customer required. See [Checkout Flow](/core-platform/box-office/checkout-flow). |
| **Disable order and reservation confirmation emails in box office** | When enabled, order confirmation and reservation emails are not sent for box office orders. Staff can still send confirmations manually from the admin order view or event dashboard. |
| **Enable order modification in box office** | Allows staff to re-open paid orders for modifications. See [After the Sale](/core-platform/box-office/after-the-sale#order-modification). |
| **Allow balance spending in box office** | Enables payments using customer account balances. A customer must be assigned to the order. |
| **Auto-redirect to box office** | Staff with the required permissions are automatically redirected to box office mode when they log in. |

<Note>
Box office mode can be disabled entirely for a company using the **Disallow box office mode** limitation. When active, staff cannot access box office mode.
</Note>

### Immersive Mode

When a staff member has limited admin menu access (typically kiosk or till operators), box office automatically enters **immersive mode**. The navigation sidebar is hidden by default, creating a distraction-free point-of-sale interface focused entirely on the selling workflow. Staff can still access the sidebar by hovering over the left edge of the screen on desktop devices.
