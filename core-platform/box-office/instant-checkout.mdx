## Overview

Instant checkout is a side panel that appears in box office mode, providing a streamlined way to complete sales without navigating through the full checkout flow. It combines customer search, basket management, and payment method selection into a single panel — ideal for high-volume sales where speed is critical.

The panel slides in from the right side of the screen when activated.

<Note>
Instant checkout can be disabled for a company using the **Disable instant checkout** limitation, which hides the instant checkout button from the box office interface.

## The Instant Checkout Panel

The panel is divided into three sections:

### Customer Search

At the top of the panel, a customer search allows staff to assign a customer to the order without leaving the current page. This works the same way as the [customer assignment step](/core-platform/box-office/checkout-flow#assigning-a-customer) in the full checkout:

- Search by name or email
- Select from suggestions
- Create a new customer
- Continue without a customer (if guest checkout is enabled)

### Include in Basket Toggle

The **Include in basket** toggle controls how items are handled:

| State | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| **Enabled** | The currently selected items are added to the existing basket and sold together with any items already in the basket |
| **Disabled** | Only the currently selected items are sold — any existing basket items are excluded from this transaction |

The help text reads: **"If enabled, any items currently selected will be sold with the items in your basket. If not, only the selected items will be sold, excluding any items in your basket."**

This allows staff to quickly sell individual items without affecting items already queued in the basket.

### Payment Methods

The lower section displays available payment methods as action buttons. Clicking a payment method immediately processes the order using that method — there is no separate confirmation step.

Available payment methods are the same as the [full checkout](/core-platform/box-office/payment-methods), with the following differences:

- **Account balance** payments are not shown in the instant checkout panel
- **Complimentary** is always shown, even when the order total is zero
- Payment methods are only shown when the order total is greater than zero (except complimentary)

The panel footer shows the order total, formatted with the basket currency.

## How It Differs from Normal Checkout

| Aspect | Normal Checkout | Instant Checkout |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Navigation** | Multi-step flow across pages | Single panel, no page navigation |
| **Customer assignment** | Dedicated checkout step | Inline search within the panel |
| **Payment selection** | Select method, then confirm | One-click — selecting a method processes immediately |
| **Billing address** | Skipped (in box office) | Not applicable |
| **Order source** | Selected during checkout | Defaults to Counter |

<Note>
The instant checkout help text explains: **"You will be navigated straight to payment or to the success page. The order will be processed under your name."** — unless a customer has been assigned through the panel's customer search.
