## Overview

After completing a box office order, the success page displays a set of actions designed for staff workflows. These actions allow staff to rapidly process the next sale, print tickets, assign customers, or manage the order — all without navigating back to the admin panel.

The actions panel appears on the right side of the success page with the heading **"Box office actions"**.

## Navigation Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Box office home** | Returns to the shop homepage to browse events and start a new order |
| **Back to event** / **Back to events** | Returns to the event page. If the order contained items from multiple events, a modal appears to select which event to return to. |

## Quick Sell Same Items

Quick sell creates an exact copy of the current order for a different customer — same items, same pricing, same discounts. This is designed for high-volume scenarios where multiple customers are purchasing the same thing, such as a queue at a venue box office.

### Using Quick Sell

1. On the success page, click **Quick sell same items**
2. A modal appears with the warning: **"Are you sure you wish to create an exact copy of this order with the same items, pricing and discounts?"**
3. Enter the customer's **name** and **email** (pre-filled from the current order's customer if one was assigned)
4. Click **Confirm**

The system creates a new order, assigns the customer, and completes it using the same payment method as the original order.

### Quick Sell Restrictions

Quick sell is not available when:

- The original order was paid with an online payment method — the message reads: **"Quick sell not supported for online payment methods, try the 'reserve same items' option instead."**
- The original order contains reserved seating items — **"Quick sell not supported for reserved seating"**

<Note>
Quick sell requires sufficient stock for the new order. If items have sold out since the original order, quick sell will fail.
</Note>

## Reserve Same Items

Reserve same items works similarly to quick sell but creates a reservation instead of completing the order immediately. This is useful when:

- The customer needs time to pay
- You want to use a different payment method than the original
- The original used an online payment method (where quick sell isn't available)

The reservation follows the standard reservation flow — the customer (or staff member) can complete payment within the reservation period.

## Print and Download

When the order contains items with downloadable media (tickets, e-tickets, etc.), printing and download actions are available:

| Action | When Shown |
|--------|------------|
| **Print** | Staff has print permissions and the order is not too large to print |
| **Download** | Staff does not have print permissions, or the order exceeds the print size limit |

If the order is too large to print directly, the help text reads: **"Order too big to print"** and staff can download instead.

<Note>
Printing and downloading are only available for completed orders — not for reservations. The order must also contain items that have downloadable media configured.
</Note>

## Rename Order

If the order was completed as the box office user (without assigning a customer), staff can rename the order after the sale:

1. Click **Rename order**
2. Enter the customer's name in the modal
3. The order's purchaser name is updated

This updates the display name on the order without creating a full customer account. It is shown as the **Named purchaser** on the order.

<Note>
Renaming is only available for orders purchased as the box office user. Orders with an assigned customer should be managed through the customer assignment flow instead.
</Note>

## Transfer Items

Staff with the appropriate permissions can transfer individual items from the completed order to another customer:

1. Click **Transfer items**
2. Follow the standard item transfer flow

This is useful when tickets were purchased under the staff member's account and need to be assigned to individual attendees.

## Refund Order

Staff with refund permissions can initiate a refund directly from the success page:

1. Click **Refund order**
2. Follow the standard refund flow

<Note>
Refunds to account balance are not available for box office orders that were completed without a customer. The system prevents this with the message: **"Refund to balance is not available for box office orders without a customer"**.
</Note>

## Order Modification

When **Enable order modification in box office** is active in company settings, staff can re-open completed orders for modifications. The setting description reads: **"Allow staff to use box office to modify existing orders"**.

This allows:

- Adding items to an existing order
- Removing items (with appropriate refund handling)
- Changing quantities

A modification cutoff can also be configured to limit how long after the original purchase an order can be modified.

<Note>
During order modification, the customer cannot be changed. The system displays: **"You cannot change the customer during box office order modification."** For full details on the order modification flow, see [Order Modification](/core-platform/order-management/order-modification).
</Note>

## Internal Notes

The success page includes an **Internal notes** section where staff can add notes to the order. These notes are visible in the admin panel but not to the customer — useful for recording special instructions, issues, or context about the sale.

## Fundraising

If the order contains items eligible for fundraising, a **Start fundraising** action appears. This opens the fundraising modal, allowing staff to process on-the-spot donations linked to the order.
