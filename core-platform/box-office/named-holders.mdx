title: "Named Holders"
description: "Capture attendee names against individual order items in box-office workflows."
---

## Overview

- Named holder values are stored at order-item level.
- Holder names can be updated through transfer/name assignment workflows used by both admin and shop contexts.
- This is distinct from the order reserver (customer-level) name.

## Where It Applies

- Ticket-level attendee naming policies configured on events
- Transfer and reassignment actions where holder names are updated
- Checkout/account flows that expose holder assignment fields
