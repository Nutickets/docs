## Overview

- Box-office orders can carry a reserver name even when a full customer account is not assigned.
- Staff can update order reserver name fields from admin and box-office checkout flows.

## Checkout Customer Rules

Depending on company and integration settings, box-office checkout can require:

- full customer assignment,
- name-only capture,
- or flexible guest handling.

Certain scenarios force customer assignment (for example specific integrations or wallet top-up baskets).
