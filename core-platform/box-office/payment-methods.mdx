## Overview

- Box-office checkout uses enabled company payment methods and method-specific eligibility rules.
- Some methods only appear when basket totals or flow conditions are met.
- Method configuration is managed through payment settings and box-office payment-method settings.

## Behaviour Highlights

- Complimentary/zero-value style methods are treated separately from paid methods.
- Balance-on-hand style methods are excluded from instant-checkout action lists.
- Manual payment and invoice controls come from company payment settings.
