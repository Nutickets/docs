## Overview

- Access codes are basket-entry codes used to unlock restricted inventory.
- Codes can target events, schedules, inventory items, or specific sale items.
- Access codes support parent/child generation patterns for campaign-style distribution.

## Core Behaviour

| Area | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Visibility gating | Codes can hide unrestricted items and only reveal eligible inventory |
| Scope assignment | Can be linked to events, schedules, items, and sale items |
| Lifecycle | Codes can be active, inactive, disabled, soft-deleted, then restored |
| Analytics | Usage and orders are tracked for reporting/export |

## Parent and Child Codes

- Parent codes can generate child code sets.
- Child activity is trackable (uses, orders, state).
- Restoring a deleted code validates collisions to avoid duplicates.

## Administration

- Managed from **Access Codes** in admin.
- Includes filtering by active/inactive/disabled/deleted state.
- Supports CSV import via data-import workflows.
