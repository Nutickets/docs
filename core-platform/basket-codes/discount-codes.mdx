description: "Configure percentage, fixed, and advanced discount logic for basket and sale-item pricing."

## Overview

- Discount codes apply pricing reductions to eligible basket lines.
- The platform supports multiple discount-code types, including targeted and conditional models.
- Codes can be manually entered, auto-applied, or generated in parent/child sets.

## Common Capabilities

| Capability | Notes |
|---|---|
| Targeting | Scope by events, schedules, sale items, items, price bands, and customer groups |
| Conditions | Supports rule-based eligibility including conditional item requirements |
| Auto-apply | Prioritised auto-apply codes with platform limits |
| Lifecycle | Active, inactive, disabled, and soft-deleted states |

## Operational Notes

- Box-office-only discounts are treated separately from standard discount-code records.
- Generated code batches expose child-level activity and can be filtered in the admin UI.
- Discount-code usage and exports are available through built-in reports.
