## Overview

External vouchers let box office staff apply discounts from third-party voucher schemes during checkout. When a customer presents a physical or digital voucher from an external provider, the operator enters the voucher code and discount value into the system, and the platform applies it to the order.

Unlike regular [discount codes](/core-platform/basket-codes/discount-codes), external vouchers:

- Are only available in **box office mode** — customers cannot apply them through the self-service shop
- Are created dynamically when first used — staff enter the voucher details, and the system creates or retrieves the matching record
- Are limited to **one use per order**
- Replace any previously applied discount code on the order

## Applying an External Voucher in Box Office

1. In the box office checkout, click **Add external voucher code**
2. Enter the **External voucher code** — the code printed on or associated with the third-party voucher
3. Optionally select a **Category** from the dropdown if [voucher categories](#voucher-categories) have been configured
4. Choose the discount type by clicking the toggle:
   - **Currency symbol** for a fixed amount discount
   - **%** for a percentage discount
5. Enter the discount amount
6. Click the submit button to apply

The discount is distributed proportionately across all items in the basket.

<Warning>
Applying an external voucher removes any discount codes already applied to the order — including other external vouchers and regular discount codes. The new voucher discount replaces them entirely.
</Warning>

### Removing an External Voucher

To remove an applied external voucher, re-open the external voucher input and submit with an amount of zero. This clears the discount from the order, allowing a different discount to be applied.

## Voucher Types

External vouchers support two discount types:

| Type | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| **Fixed amount** | Reduces the order by a specific monetary value (e.g. £10 off) |
| **Percentage** | Reduces the order by a percentage of the total (e.g. 25% off, up to 100%) |

The operator selects the type each time they apply a voucher, matching the terms of the third-party voucher being redeemed.

## Voucher Categories

Categories let you organise external vouchers by their source scheme for tracking and reporting purposes. When categories are configured, a dropdown appears in the external voucher input allowing the operator to tag each voucher with its scheme.

Categories help you:

- Track redemption volumes per third-party voucher programme
- Report on the total discount value given through each scheme
- Compare the impact of different voucher partnerships

<Note>
Categories are optional. If no categories have been configured, the category dropdown does not appear and vouchers are created without a category.
</Note>

## Managing External Vouchers

External voucher records are listed in the admin under **External voucher codes**. This page shows all voucher codes that have been created through box office usage.

Each entry displays:

- The voucher code
- Discount type (fixed or percentage)
- Discount amount
- Category (if assigned)
- Usage count

You can filter the list to show or hide deleted vouchers.

<Note>
External voucher records are stored internally as a type of discount code. The same state controls apply — vouchers that have been used in orders can be disabled but not fully deleted, preserving the order history.
</Note>

## Reporting

Two dedicated reports provide insight into external voucher usage:

| Report | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **External Voucher Code Usage** | Shows usage per individual voucher code — including code, type, category, total discounted amount, and total uses |
| **External Voucher Code Category Usage** | Shows aggregated usage per category — category name, total discounted amount, and total uses |

Use the category report to evaluate the overall impact of each third-party voucher programme, and the code-level report to track individual voucher redemptions.

## Permissions

Box office staff must have the **Box office: Can apply external vouchers** permission to use external vouchers. This is a separate permission from:

- Applying regular discount codes (available to all box office users with discount access)
- Applying custom discounts (requires the **Box office: Can apply custom discounts** permission)

## How External Vouchers Differ from Discount Codes

| Aspect | Discount Codes | External Vouchers |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Created by | Admin, in advance | Box office staff, at point of use |
| Available in | Shop and/or box office | Box office only |
| Code entered by | Customer or staff | Staff only |
| Discount types | Fixed, percentage, Buy X Get Y, multi-buy | Fixed or percentage only |
| Reusability | Configurable via usage limits | One use per order |
| When applied | Replaces other discount codes | Removes all other discounts |
