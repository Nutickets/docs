## Overview

- External vouchers are represented as a dedicated external-voucher discount code type.
- They are primarily used in box-office workflows where staff applies fixed or percentage reductions from third-party voucher schemes.
- Voucher records are listed in admin for visibility and auditing.

## Box Office Flow

1. Operator enters external voucher value in box-office checkout.
2. Platform finds or creates the voucher-backed discount code.
3. Discount is applied to the active order.
4. Removing the value clears discount lines from the order.

## Notes

- External voucher records are managed as discount-code entities, so standard permission and state controls still apply.
- Customer-facing self-serve voucher entry uses standard discount-code paths, not the box-office external voucher endpoint.
