This documentation serves as the central reference manual for the Nuweb platform. It provides a complete overview of the platform's features, configuration options, and operational controls.

## Purpose of this Manual

This guide is designed to function as a knowledge base for navigating the platform's capabilities & ecosystem. It details the available settings and logic for every corner of the system including context, use-cases and helpful references.

Use this reference to:

- **Verify System Logic:** Understand the rules, limitations & concepts that govern how the platform operates.
- **Explore Configuration Options:** Review the available settings for system features to determine the best setup for your specific use case.
- **Troubleshoot Operations:** Locate the specific controls required to manage day-to-day tasks and resolve common operational scenarios.

## Documentation Structure

The manual is organized into logical functional groups. Topics with significant depth or complexity are broken out into dedicated categories to provide comprehensive detail.

Where functionality depends on or interacts with other areas of the platform, cross-references are provided to link relevant sections. Use the sidebar navigation or the global search to locate specific features.

## Getting Started

Navigate using the sidebar to find the specific module or functional area you need. Most sections begin with a **Core Concepts/Introduction** page explaining the fundamental logic before detailing specific settings. Use the **glossary** to get comfortable with the terminology used in this documentation.

<Note>
  In addition to this user manual, refer to the **Mobile Apps** guides for hardware operations, the **Release Notes** for a full product changelog, and the **API** references for technical integrations.
