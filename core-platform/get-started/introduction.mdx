The Nuweb platform is an event management and ticketing system. You use it to create events, sell tickets and products, manage customers, process payments, control venue access, and run on-site operations — all from a single admin dashboard.

This documentation is a reference for everything the platform can do. Whether you're setting up your first event or looking up how a specific feature works, start here to understand how the pieces fit together.

## How the Platform Is Structured

Everything in the platform revolves around a few core concepts. Understanding these will help you navigate both the system and this documentation.

### Companies

A **company** is your account on the platform. It's where all your events, customers, orders, and settings live. Each company has its own [ticket shop](/core-platform/ticket-shop/homepage) — a public-facing website where customers browse and purchase.

Companies can operate independently or as part of a parent–child structure, where a parent company manages shared settings and features across multiple child companies.

### Events

[Events](/core-platform/event-management/introduction) are the central building block. An event has a date, a location (physical, online, or both), and one or more things to sell. Events can be standalone or grouped into a [schedule](/core-platform/event-management/schedules) for recurring or multi-date series.

Each event is configured with its own [capacity controls](/core-platform/event-management/capacity-controls), [access control rules](/core-platform/event-management/access-control), [sales periods](/core-platform/event-management/sales-periods), and [page customisations](/core-platform/event-management/event-page-customisations).

### Sale Items

A [sale item](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts) is anything a customer can purchase — tickets, products, guest list entries, donations, season tickets, or bundles. Each sale item is configured with its own pricing, stock, on-sale dates, and sales channel visibility.

Sale items are sold through an **inventory** — the entity that owns and lists them. Events are the most common inventory, but sale items can also belong to [EPOS shops](/core-platform/epos/overview) or to the company itself (for items sold independently of any event).

Sale items can be enhanced with [add-ons](/core-platform/sale-items/add-ons), restricted to [customer groups](/core-platform/customer-management/customer-groups), and organised into [groups](/core-platform/event-management/sale-item-groups) that control how they appear to customers.

### Orders & Customers

When a customer completes a purchase, it becomes an [order](/core-platform/order-management/core-concepts). Orders contain individual order items — each with a unique barcode — and support [refunds](/core-platform/order-management/refunds-and-cancellations), [modifications](/core-platform/order-management/order-modifications), and [transfers](/core-platform/event-management/item-transfers).

Customers are created automatically when someone makes a purchase or registers an account. You can [manage customer profiles](/core-platform/customer-management/managing-customers), [merge duplicates](/core-platform/customer-management/merging-customers), and segment customers into [groups](/core-platform/customer-management/customer-groups) for targeted access and pricing.

## Sales Channels

Sale items can be made available across multiple sales channels, and each channel serves a different selling context:

| Channel | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Ticket Shop** | Your [customer-facing website](/core-platform/ticket-shop/homepage). Customers browse events, select items, and check out on their own. The shop supports [event listings](/core-platform/ticket-shop/browsing-and-search), [search](/core-platform/ticket-shop/browsing-and-search), a [global basket](/core-platform/ticket-shop/basket) across multiple events, and [guest checkout](/core-platform/ticket-shop/checkout). Its appearance is controlled through the [CMS](/core-platform/cms/theme-and-branding). |
| **Box Office** | [Staff-assisted web sales](/core-platform/box-office/introduction) — at the door, over the phone, or anywhere a staff member is helping a customer. Runs inside the shop with staff authentication, adding operational tools like [instant checkout](/core-platform/box-office/instant-checkout), [named orders](/core-platform/box-office/named-orders), and additional [payment methods](/core-platform/box-office/payment-methods). |
| **Mobile Box Office** | Staff-assisted sales through the [Box Office Pro](/mobile-apps/box-office-pro) mobile app, designed for on-the-ground selling with connected hardware. |
| **Kiosk** | Self-service purchasing for customers at a physical location, without staff involvement. |
| **API** | Programmatic sales through the [public API](/api-reference/introduction), enabling third-party integrations and custom sales flows. |

Each sale item can be independently enabled or disabled per channel, so you can control exactly where each item is available for purchase.
