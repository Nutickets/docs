## Overview

The platform uses email as its primary notification channel. Emails are sent automatically throughout key workflows — order confirmations when a purchase completes, payment links when a reservation is approved, refund confirmations when a cancellation is processed — and can also be sent manually in bulk by admin users.

Every email is tracked through [email logs](/core-platform/notifications/email-logs), giving visibility into what was sent, to whom, and whether delivery succeeded.

## How Emails Work

Emails fall into two categories based on how they are triggered:

| Category | How it works | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Automatic** | Sent by the platform when a workflow event occurs — no manual action required | Order confirmations, payment links, refund confirmations, transfer claim emails |
| **Manual** | Triggered by an admin user, either individually or in bulk | Resending a confirmation email, emailing all attendees of an event, sending payment reminders |

Both categories are processed through a queue, so emails are not sent instantaneously. Automatic emails from checkout workflows are prioritised and typically arrive within seconds. Bulk emails sent to large audiences are processed at a controlled rate and may take longer — the platform displays a confirmation that emails have been added to the queue.

## What You Can Control

The platform provides several layers of control over email notifications:

- **Which emails are sent** — Company and event-level settings control whether specific email types are enabled or disabled. For example, you can suppress order confirmation emails in box office, or enable automatic event reminder emails. See [Email Settings](/core-platform/notifications/email-settings).

- **What emails say** — Email subjects, greetings, body text, and calls to action can all be customised per company through the website text manager. Customisations can also be scoped to specific events, schedules, or customer groups. See [Customising Emails](/core-platform/notifications/customising-emails).

- **Who emails come from** — The sender name, from address, and reply-to address are configurable at the company level, with a fallback to reseller-level defaults. See [Sender Configuration](/core-platform/notifications/email-settings#sender-configuration).

- **Who receives admin emails** — Purchase summary emails and event creation notifications can be directed to specific email addresses configured per event or at the company level. See [Email Settings](/core-platform/notifications/email-settings).
