## Overview

SMS messaging is used for key reservation lifecycle updates where enabled.

## Common Reservation SMS Cases

- Reservation approved with no payment required.
- Reservation approved with payment pending (payment link sent).
- Reservation rejected.

These are triggered by reservation approval/rejection flows and can be offered in bulk review tools depending on configuration.

## Operational Notes

- SMS delivery depends on configured SMS integrations/providers.
- Keep templates short and include clear next action where applicable.
- Use email as fallback for long-form guidance.
