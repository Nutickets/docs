## Overview

Every email the platform sends is logged and can be reviewed through the email logs. This gives you visibility into what was sent, who received it, whether delivery succeeded, and — if you have the right permissions — the email content itself.

Email logs are accessible in two ways: a dedicated **Email Logs** page showing all emails across the company, and inline log panels on individual order, reservation, and customer pages showing emails related to that specific record.

## Viewing the Email Logs Page

Navigate to **Email Logs** in the admin sidebar to see all emails sent by the company.

The page displays a grid with the following columns:

| Column | What it shows |
|--------|--------------|
| **Type** | The email type (e.g. Order confirmation, Payment link, Event reminder) |
| **Recipients** | The recipient's name and email address |
| **Sent At / Queued At** | When the email was sent and when it was queued |
| **Status** | The current delivery status |

### Filtering Emails

Use the filters panel to narrow down the list:

| Filter | Options |
|--------|---------|
| **Recipient** | Search by name or email address |
| **Email Type** | Filter by a specific email type (Order confirmation, Tax receipt, Deposit received, Payment link, Reservation, Claim your items, Order rejected, Refund confirmation, Event reminder, and others) |
| **Status** | Show all emails, only **Sent**, or only **Queued** |

### Email Statuses

Each email has one of four statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Pending** | The email has been created but not yet added to the send queue |
| **Queued** | The email has been queued for delivery and is being processed |
| **Sent** | The email was delivered to the email service successfully |
| **Failed** | The email could not be sent after multiple attempts |

<Note>
A **Sent** status means the email was accepted by the email delivery service. It does not guarantee the email reached the recipient's inbox — it may still be caught by spam filters or bounced by the recipient's email provider.
</Note>

## Viewing Email Details

Click any row in the email logs grid to open a detail panel showing the full email record:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Status** | Delivery status with timestamp |
| **Type** | The email type label |
| **Sender** | The admin user who triggered the email (for manually sent emails) |
| **From** | The sender name and email address |
| **To** | The recipient's name and email address |
| **CC** | Carbon copy recipients (if any) |
| **BCC** | Blind carbon copy recipients (if any) |
| **Subject** | The email subject line |
| **Email Language** | The language the email was sent in |
| **Queued At** | When the email was added to the queue |
| **Sent At** | When the email was successfully sent |
| **Company** | The company the email was sent for |

### Viewing Email Content

If the email has stored HTML content and you have the **View email media** permission, a **Show** button appears in the detail panel. Clicking it displays the email body in a preview frame, rendered exactly as the recipient would see it.

<Note>
Links in the email preview are disabled to prevent accidental clicks. The preview is read-only.
</Note>

## Viewing Emails for a Specific Record

Email logs are also accessible directly from order, reservation, and customer pages, showing only emails related to that record.

### From an Order or Reservation

On the order or reservation detail page, click the envelope icon in the quick actions to open the email log panel. This shows two sets of logs:

- **Order emails** — all emails linked to this specific order (confirmations, payment links, refunds, etc.)
- **Customer emails** — all emails sent to the customer across all their orders

The panel also provides quick action buttons to resend emails. See [Sending Emails](/core-platform/notifications/sending-emails) for details on resending.

### From a Customer Record

On the customer detail page, the envelope icon opens a panel showing all emails ever sent to that customer. This is useful for checking whether a customer received a specific email or for reviewing their complete email history.

## Permissions

Access to email logs is controlled by two permissions:

| Permission | What it controls |
|------------|-----------------|
| **View email logs** | Access to the Email Logs page and the email log panels on order, reservation, and customer pages |
| **View email media** | Ability to preview the HTML content of sent emails |

Users without the **View email logs** permission see a simplified **Resend confirmation email** quick action instead of the email log panel on order pages.
