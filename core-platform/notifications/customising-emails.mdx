## Overview

Every email the platform sends uses default text that can be customised per company. Customisations are managed through the website text manager — the same tool used to customise other text across the platform. You can change email subjects, greetings, body content, and calls to action without touching any code.

Customisations can also be scoped to specific events, event schedules, or customer groups, so you can tailor email content for different audiences while keeping a company-wide default.

## Accessing the Text Manager

1. Navigate to **Settings > Website Text**
2. Open the **Category** dropdown
3. Select an email template from the **Emails** group

The dropdown groups all customisable text by type. Email templates appear under the **Emails** heading.

## Available Email Templates

The following email templates can be customised:

| Template | What it controls |

## Editing Email Content

When you select an email template, the page displays each editable field in a two-column layout:

- **Left column** — The default text (read-only), showing what the platform sends if no customisation is applied
- **Right column** — Your custom override, where you can enter replacement text

Fields are organised into groups, typically **Main Content** for the primary editable text and **Advanced** for additional options.

### Field Types

Each field uses the input format best suited to its content:

| Type | Used for |
|------|----------|
| **Text** | Short values like email subjects |
| **Textarea** | Multi-line plain text like email body content |
| **Rich text editor** | HTML content with formatting (bold, italic, links) |

### Placeholders

Many email fields support dynamic placeholders that are replaced with real values when the email is sent. Available placeholders are displayed below the input field as badges.

Common placeholders include:

| Placeholder | Replaced with |
|-------------|--------------|
| `:name` | The customer's name |
| `:reference` | The order reference number |
| `:company` | The company name |
| `:platform` | The platform name |
| `:total` | The order total amount |
| `:url` | A link to the customer's account or order |
| `:eventName` | The event name |
| `:sender` | The name of the person sharing items (transfer emails) |
| `:deposit_amount` | The deposit amount received |
| `:remaining_amount` | The remaining balance due |
| `:expires` | The reservation expiry date |

<Note>
The placeholders shown for each field are specific to that email type. Only use the placeholders displayed — other placeholder names will appear as literal text in the sent email.
</Note>

### Restoring Defaults

Each field has a **Restore default** link. Clicking it reverts the field to the platform's original text. If you customise a field and then change it back to match the default exactly, the customisation is automatically removed.

## Multi-Language Support

If the company supports multiple languages, a locale switcher appears on each field. Switching the locale shows the default text and your custom override for that language.

The fallback chain when sending an email is:

1. Custom text for the email's locale
2. Custom text for the company's fallback language
3. Default text in English

The email locale is determined by the customer's language preference or the language selected during checkout.

## Scoping Customisations

By default, customisations apply company-wide — every email of that type uses the customised text. For more targeted customisation, you can scope overrides to specific entities.

### Per Event

Most email templates support per-event overrides. When available, an **Event** dropdown appears above the editing fields. Select a specific event to create an override that only applies to emails related to that event.

If the event also belongs to an event schedule, an **Event Schedule** dropdown appears alongside the event dropdown, allowing you to scope the override to the schedule level instead.

**Resolution order:** When an email is sent for a specific event, the platform looks for text overrides in this order:

1. Override scoped to the specific event
2. Override scoped to the event's schedule
3. Company-wide override
4. Platform default text

### Per Customer Group

The **Added to customer group email** template supports per-group overrides. A **Customer Group** dropdown appears when this template is selected, allowing you to customise the welcome email content for each group individually.

<Note>
Per-event and per-schedule overrides are only applied when the email relates to a single event or a single schedule. For orders spanning multiple unrelated events, the company-wide override is used.
</Note>

## Customising Reminder Emails

The event reminder email can also be reached directly from the event's **Email Preferences** modal. Click **Customise reminder email** to jump to the text manager with the event reminder template and the current event pre-selected.

See [Automatic Event Reminder Emails](/core-platform/notifications/email-settings#automatic-event-reminder-emails) for setting up reminders.
