## Overview

Revisions track structural changes made to seating plans after those plans are already in use by events.

They let event teams apply plan updates intentionally, instead of automatically overwriting event-level data every time the source plan changes.

## When Revisions Are Created

A revision is created only when all of the following are true:

| Condition | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| **Plan has attached events** | Revisions are only generated once the plan is in event use. |
| **A save includes a change delta** | No delta, no revision record. |
| **Change is saved at plan or area level** | Both whole-plan saves and large-plan area saves can produce revisions. |

If a plan has never been attached to events, saves update the plan directly without creating revision history for event sync.

## What A Revision Represents

Revisions capture schema changes such as:
- New or removed spaces/seats
- Structural edits to layout objects
- Plan/area schema updates that need to be reflected in synced event copies

Revisions do **not** automatically mutate event data until a sync action is run from the event context.

## Applying Revisions To Events

Applying revisions is an event-level action from **Plan settings**.

- **Apply revisions** imports pending plan changes since the last completed sync.
- **Factory reset** rebuilds event seating from source plan state and overrides event-specific customisations.

Event-level details are documented in [Seated Events](/core-platform/event-management/seated-events).

<Warning>
Factory reset is a high-impact operation and is generally intended for setup phases, not mid-sale operational windows.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

1. Finalise major structural edits before attaching plans to production events where possible.
2. Use **Apply revisions** for ongoing incremental updates.
3. Reserve **Factory reset** for scenarios where full event seating regeneration is explicitly required.
