## Overview

Seating plans define your reusable venue layout: seats, rows, tables, general admission areas, labels, and plan-level settings.

Each seating plan belongs to a single venue, and a venue can have multiple seating plans.

This section covers the **authoring side** of seating:

- Creating plans
- Choosing a plan type
- Building layouts in the editor
- Managing revisions
- Managing holds

Operational workflows such as attaching plans to events, syncing event data, and managing event-level availability are covered in [Seated Events](/core-platform/event-management/seated-events).

## How Seating Plans Fit Into The Workflow

1. Create a seating plan from **Seating plans**.
2. Choose a plan type (small/medium or large), or import an existing plan file.
3. Build and save the layout in the editor.
4. Complete the plan by setting a **Name** and **Venue**.
5. Attach and sync the plan to one or more events from the event workflow.

<Note>
  Plans must be complete before they can be attached to events. Incomplete plans
  can be saved as drafts and continued later.
</Note>

## Access And Requirements

| Requirement               | Details                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Seating plans feature** | Your company must have seating plans enabled.                                                       |
| **Permissions**           | You need the relevant seating plan permissions to view/create/edit plans.                           |
| **Venue access**          | Plan completion requires a venue, and venue selection is constrained to venues you can access.      |
| **Large plans**           | Large plan creation is only available when your company has the large-plan seating context enabled. |

## Plan Types

When you create a new seating plan, you choose a type:

- **Small / medium plan**
- **Large plan** (if enabled for your company)

The type controls how the editor behaves and how the layout is structured.

### Type Comparison

| Type               | Best for                                            | Structure                              | Capacity guidance              | Availability                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Small / medium** | Theatres, cinemas, comedy clubs, and similar venues | Single canvas                          | Up to **1,000 seats** per plan | Available when seating plans are enabled |
| **Large**          | Stadiums and large multi-zone venues                | Main plan with separate editable areas | Up to **1,000 seats per area** | Requires the large-plan seating context  |

<Note>
  The editor shows live seat counters and enforces seat/space limits while you
  build.
</Note>

### Choosing A Type

From **Create seating plan**, you can:

- Start a new small/medium plan
- Start a new large plan (if available)
- Import an existing plan file
- Continue an incomplete draft

For exports and imports:

- Use **Export** in the seating plan editor to download a plan file.
- Use **Create seating plan** and choose **Import** to upload a previously exported file.
- Small plan import supports `.nuspx`.
- Large plan import supports `.nuspx` and `.nuspb` (when large plans are enabled).

### Important Behaviours

#### Type Is Fixed After Creation

Once a plan exists, its type is preserved on future saves. If you need a different type, create a new plan.

#### Large Plans Use Area Editing

Large plans are designed around areas:

- Build the high-level area map in the main view
- Enter an area to edit its detailed seat content
- Save area changes back to the main plan

#### Feature Gating

If a large plan file is imported into a company without large-plan access, the import is blocked and users are prompted to use supported plan types.

## What You’ll See In The Seating Plans Area

- A primary list of complete plans.
- A separate flow for continuing recent incomplete drafts.
- A holds tab (when holds are enabled and you have access), used to manage reusable hold groups.
