## Overview

The seating plan editor is the authoring workspace for building and maintaining reusable plan schemas.

This page focuses on creation and design tooling:

- Drawing areas, blocks, rows, tables, and general admission areas
- Configuring labels, metadata, and visual behavior
- Managing object-level properties and plan-level settings
- Running plan checks before save/export

Operational event workflows (assigning plans to events, event availability, event pricing allocation, holds at event level) are documented in [Seated Events](/core-platform/event-management/seated-events).

### Seats

| Tool                        | What it does                                            | Why/when to use it                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |

<Note>
  The top-right seat counter displays `current / max seats` for the active
  scope. The editor enforces hard seat/space limits and will disable creation
  tools when the limit is reached.
</Note>

<Note>
  Some teams call removed seats **kills**. In editor terms, this usually maps to
  structural seat removal (**Delete selected seats** / **Restore selected
  seats**). Event-level sale controls are documented in [Seated
  Events](/core-platform/event-management/seated-events).
</Note>

### Hidden Vs Delete Seats

Use these two tools for different outcomes:

| Option     | Use it when                                                                   | Key behavior                                                                      |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hidden** | You want seats out of sale/customer view but may need them back later         | Seats stay in the plan structure and keep their labels; unhide is available later |
| **Delete** | You are making structural plan changes and want seats removed from the schema | Seats are marked as deleted, labels are removed, and restore requires delete mode |

### Deletion Limits And Guardrails

- **Attached-event limitation:** once a plan has already been synced to events, existing synced seats cannot be deleted in the editor. Use **Hidden** instead for operational removals.
- **Capacity limitation:** you cannot **unhide** or **restore** seats when the plan is already at its hard seat limit.
- **Mutual exclusivity:** setting seats to hidden clears deleted state, and deleting seats clears hidden state.
- **Restore workflow:** use **Show deleted seats** to select deleted seats before running **Restore selected seats**.

If your goal is event-level availability management (rather than changing plan structure), use event seat statuses in [Seated Events](/core-platform/event-management/seated-events).

<Note>
  When best-available seats is enabled, the wizard warns that tables requiring
  whole-table booking are excluded from best-seat suggestions.
</Note>

## Icon Library

- **Center area**
- Area context indicator (main area vs active area)

Area state warnings appear when:

- Label settings changed and area labels need recalculation
- Focal point scoring changed and area scores need recalculation

### Layer List

When no single object is selected, the panel shows a draggable layer list for:

- Reordering objects
- Selecting objects directly from layer entries
- Seeing area/type badges per layer

### Taxonomy Management Tools

#### Price Bands

- Add new price band
- Edit label, color, and marker shape
- Apply selected price band to selected seats/GA
- Toggle shop display behavior:
  - Show price band colors/shapes
  - Show unavailable items in filters
  - Show unavailable legend

#### Gates, Stairs, Stands, Tags

Common management pattern:

- Add new item
- Rename item term (for example, custom gate/stair naming)
- Edit item metadata
- Apply to selection / remove from selection

Tags include extra metadata:

- Color
- Description
- Used as filter
- Used as tooltip
- Show as ticket info

## Object Property Tooling

The **Properties** tab is object-type aware.

## View-From-Seat (3D) Tooling

When **View from seat settings** is available:

- Set 3D venue ID at plan level
- Map seat-level view IDs
- Paginate through seat mappings
- Save mappings (and optionally **Save all areas** on large plans)

## Tips And Shortcuts

The settings panel exposes shortcut guidance for selected objects, including:

- Rotate by small increments with modifier + left/right arrows
- Rotate by larger increments with modifier + up/down arrows
- Move objects with arrow keys
- Increase move distance with `Shift`

## Guardrails And Limits

- Seat/space hard limits block further creation once reached.
- Input controls for block/table/row creation clamp to allowed ranges.
- Some operations are constrained when plans have events/sales attached.
- Area deletion is restricted for saved areas when events are attached.
- Image-in-shop toggles are disabled above file-size threshold.
