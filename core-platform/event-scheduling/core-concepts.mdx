## Overview

- A schedule is a group of events
- Schedules can be created by either linking/attaching multiple separate standalone events together or by turning a single event into a repeating series. It's also possible to mix-and-match by attaching standalone events to existing repeating series and vice versa.
- Repeating events configuration:
  - Repeating interval:
    - Daily: Repeat every n days.
    - Weekly: Select which day of the week to repeat on, i.e. Tuesdays & Thursdays.
    - Monthly: Select which dates of the month to repeat, i.e. 2nd, 13th and 26th.
    - Annually: once a year on the selected date.
    - Custom: hand-pick which dates to schedule the event for.
  - Set a repeat start window: i.e. repeat from 1st january
  - Set an end by configuring an end window OR a final number of events: i.e. repeat until 31st january, or repeat for 30 days (capped at 31 days per single action)
  - Individual days can be selectively removed, i.e. an event may be repeated every day until the end of the month, except for thursday the 6th and all saturdays.
  - Publish the events automatically during their creation, or manually 1-by-1.
- Individual events may be removed from a schedule (unscheduled), reverting them back into a standalone event.

## Configuration

- Schedule type: Select the schedule type which best suits the type of events within this schedule.
  - Mixed events: Events are related but unique. A dedicated schedule listing page will be used to allow customers to navigate between dates in the schedule.

## Schedule Groups

Schedule groups can be utilised to organise & sub divide larger recurring schedules.

- Events can be further grouped inside of Schedules to form Schedule Groups
- An event may only belong to a single group but can be freely moved between groups.
- By default, events are all "ungrouped" & reside in the root of the schedule.
- Changes applied to events in a schedule can be applied to the full schedule OR to just the events in the sub-group within the schedule.
