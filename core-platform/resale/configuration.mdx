## Core Settings

| **Listing window start** | How far before event start customers can list. |
| **Purchase window start/end** | When resale purchases are allowed. |
| **Payout mode** | Where seller proceeds are sent. |
| **Sales channel** | Where resale is visible (web-only or wider contexts). |
| **Pricing strategy** | How resale prices can be set (plus optional min/max margins). |
| **Fee payer split** | Whether buyer, seller, or both pay fees (with seller contribution where relevant). |
