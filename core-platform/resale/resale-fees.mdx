## Overview

Resale fees are charges applied to resale transactions — separate from your standard event fees. They let you capture revenue from secondary market activity and cover the operational cost of facilitating resale.

Resale fees work like other fee sale items in the platform, but they are specifically scoped to resale transactions. They can be created at two levels:

- **Company-level resale fees** — Apply to all resale transactions across all events
- **Event-level resale fees** — Apply only to resale transactions for a specific event

Who actually pays these fees — the buyer, the seller, or both — is controlled by the [fee payer](/core-platform/resale/configuration#fee-payer) setting in your resale configuration.

## Company-Level Resale Fees

Company-level resale fees apply to every resale transaction across your entire account. Use these for standard platform fees that should apply regardless of the event.

### Creating a Company Resale Fee

1. Navigate to **Resale fees** in the admin panel
2. Click **Add new resale fee**
3. Configure the fee (see [Fee Settings](#fee-settings) below)
4. Save the fee

The fee will apply to all resale purchases across all events. A help message confirms: **Create a resale fee that will be applied to all resale items across all events.**

### Managing Company Resale Fees

The **Resale fees** page lists all company-level resale fees with their pricing and status. From here you can:

- **Edit** an existing fee to update its pricing or settings
- **Restore** a previously deleted fee

Fees that are past their active sale period are hidden by default. Use the filter to show off-sale fees.

## Event-Level Resale Fees

Event-level resale fees apply only to resale transactions for a specific event. Use these when you need different fee structures for different events, or when a particular event warrants additional charges.

### Creating an Event Resale Fee

1. Open the event dashboard
2. Navigate to the resale fees section
3. Click to create a new resale fee
4. Configure the fee (see [Fee Settings](#fee-settings) below)
5. Optionally assign the fee to specific sale items within the event

If you do not assign the fee to specific sale items, it applies to all resale purchases for tickets, products, and season tickets at that event.

### Assigning to Specific Sale Items

When creating or editing an event-level resale fee, you can restrict it to specific sale items. This is useful when different ticket types should have different fee structures — for example, applying a higher fee to premium tickets.

<Note>
If you do not specify sale items, all resale purchases for tickets, products, and season tickets at the event will be charged this fee.

## Fee Settings

When creating or editing a resale fee, the following settings are available:

### Basic Information

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | The display name for the fee, visible in the basket and order summary |
| **Code** | An internal reference code |
| **Description** | Optional description of the fee |

### Pricing

Resale fees support the same pricing configuration as other fee sale items:

- **Fixed pricing** — A set fee amount per item or per order
- **Variable fee** — A percentage of the item price
- **Multiple currencies** — Set pricing for each currency your company supports (fiat currencies only)

### Application Mode

Resale fees can be applied in two ways:

| Mode | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| **Per item** | The fee is applied to each qualifying resale item in the basket |
| **Per order** | The fee is applied once per resale order, regardless of how many items are purchased |

### Tax

Configure the tax band for the fee. If your company has conditional tax bands enabled, you can set different tax rates based on country classifications.

### Active Period

Set an active date range to control when the fee is charged. Fees outside their active period are not applied to transactions.

## How Fees Are Split

Who pays resale fees is controlled by the [fee payer](/core-platform/resale/configuration#fee-payer) setting in your resale configuration, not on the individual fee item. The four options are:

| Option | Effect on fees |
|--------|----------------|
| **Buyer pays all** | All resale fees are added on top of the listing price. The buyer sees them in their basket. |
| **Seller pays all** | All resale fees are deducted from the seller's proceeds. The buyer does not see resale fees in their basket. |
| **Buyer and seller split** | The seller contributes a configured percentage of the listing price toward fees. Remaining fees are covered by the buyer. |
| **Seller can choose** | The seller decides during listing setup whether the buyer pays all fees or whether they contribute. |

For full details on configuring fee payer settings, see [Resale Configuration](/core-platform/resale/configuration#fee-payer).

## Fee Transparency

How buyers see resale fees in the basket is controlled by the [fee transparency](/core-platform/resale/configuration#fee-transparency) setting:

- **High** — Buyers see individual resale fee line items in the basket, as well as the value of any seller contributions toward those fees
- **Low** — Buyers see a single **Resale fees** summary line in the basket and cannot see how much the seller has contributed

## Standard Fees and Resale

Standard event fees (non-resale fees) have an option to control whether they apply to resale orders:

- **Applies to resale orders** — When enabled, the fee is included in resale transactions as well as standard purchases
- **Omit from resale orders** — When enabled, the fee is excluded from resale transactions

This allows you to keep standard booking fees on resale orders or exclude them, depending on your fee structure.

## Permissions

Managing resale fees requires both resale feature access and fee management permissions. Without the appropriate permissions, the resale fees pages are not accessible.
