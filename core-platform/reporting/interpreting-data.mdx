## Overview

Report numbers are only meaningful in the context of their filters, grouping strategy, and status windows. This page helps you read outputs consistently.

## Interpretation Checklist

1. Confirm active filters (date range, event/schedule/company, status, payment methods).
2. Confirm grouping and secondary grouping.
3. Confirm interval buckets (if used).
4. Confirm whether values are gross/net/tax and which currency context applies.
5. Confirm inclusion/exclusion of pending, failed, refunded, or resale states.

## Common Pitfalls

- Comparing grouped totals to ungrouped totals without matching filters.
- Mixing multiple currencies without conversion context.
- Treating incomplete/awaiting-payment orders as finalized revenue.
- Forgetting visibility/permission scope when comparing between users.

## Recommended Practice

- Save a custom report for each recurring KPI use case.
- Keep naming conventions explicit (`Sales - Net - Completed - Last 30 Days`).
- Use scheduled reports for consistency, not ad-hoc filter changes.
