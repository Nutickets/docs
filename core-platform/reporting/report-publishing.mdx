## Overview

Report publishing covers generated export artifacts and optional endpoint delivery.

## Export Records

Each export creates a report export record with:

- file metadata (`filename`, `filepath`, content type)
- progress and completion timestamps
- source context (report page/source URL)
- optional parent/child export relationships for multi-part outputs

## Access and Download

- Download and view routes use **signed URLs**.
- Signed links can be opened without full admin auth middleware, but still require valid signatures.

## Progress and Failure

- Processing exports show in-progress state.
- Stalled/old incomplete exports are surfaced as failed in the UI.
- Parent export progress is calculated from child completion ratio.

## Endpoint Publishing

When a data endpoint is attached, publishing outcomes are stored per export and can be inspected from export details.
