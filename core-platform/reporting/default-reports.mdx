## How to Use This Reference

This page documents every report type available in the platform, organised by the categories you see on the reports listing page. For each report type, you will find:

- **What the report shows** — a plain-language summary of the data
- **Available reports** — the pre-configured report views (templates) within that category, each with different default filters and groupings
- **Fields** — every column you can add to the report, organised by field group
- **Groupings** — how you can aggregate results
- **Key filters** — notable filters specific to this report type
- **Time intervals** — whether the report supports time-based bucketing

For general guidance on using filters, fields, groupings, sorting, and exporting, see [Using Reports](/core-platform/reporting/using-reports).

<Note>
Many reports in the same category share the same underlying data engine with different default configurations. For example, **Ticket sales report**, **Product sales report**, and **Guest list sales report** all use the event sales engine but default to different item type filters. This means they share the same available fields, groupings, and filters — the difference is in what is pre-selected when you open them.
