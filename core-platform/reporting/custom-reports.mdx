## Overview

Custom reports are saved report definitions built on top of report types. They persist your chosen filters, columns, grouping, interval, conditionals, and mapping settings.

## Create a Custom Report

1. Open a default or existing report view.
2. Use **Create** to save a new custom report.
3. Provide a report name and optional description.
4. Save settings (headers/filter/grouping/order/interval and related configuration).

## What Gets Saved

Custom reports store settings including:

- `headers`
- `filter`
- `grouping`
- `secondary_grouping`
- `order`
- `interval`
- `map`
- `prefix`
- conditional settings

## Editing and Deleting

- Use report edit to rename/update description and settings.
- Deleting removes the custom report definition, not underlying business data.

## Widgets and Dashboards

Custom reports can contain widgets (pie, bar, stacked bar, line, horizontal variants). Widget configuration pulls available grouped headers from the report definition.

## Scheduling Compatibility

Custom reports can be scheduled. Hourly scheduling availability depends on frequent-scheduled-report feature access for the owning company/reseller.
