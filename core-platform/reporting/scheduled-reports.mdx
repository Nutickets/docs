## Overview

Scheduled reports run custom reports automatically and deliver results to recipients (and optionally to configured data endpoints).

## Schedule Components

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Recipients** | Email recipients for generated report output. |
| **From / Until** | Active window for when the schedule is allowed to run. |
| **Timezone** | Timezone used for cron due checks. |
| **Expression / schedule mode** | Daily/weekly/monthly/hourly style cadence depending on config. |
| **Format** | Export format for scheduled output. |
| **Send if empty** | Whether to dispatch even when dataset is empty. |
| **Data endpoint** | Optional destination for published results. |

## Runtime Behavior

- A schedule only runs when current time is between `from` and `until` and cron expression is due.
- Next/last run times are calculated in schedule timezone.
- Run history is tracked and visible in the scheduled reports list.

## Manual Dispatch

You can dispatch a scheduled report immediately from the UI without waiting for the next scheduled due time.
