## Overview

Reporting has two primary modes:

- **Default reports**: predefined report templates.
- **Custom reports**: saved, editable report definitions with custom settings.

The report engine supports filtering, grouping, intervals, column selection, widget visualization, and exports.

## Report Types

Custom reports map to report-type classes (for example sales, attendance, orders, customers, invoices, scanning, transfers, discount/access codes, seating plan utilization, wallets, and exchange-rate style datasets).

## Core Building Blocks

| Building block | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Filters** | Narrow dataset (event, schedule, venue, company, date, status, payment method, etc.). |
| **Headers** | Select fields/columns included in output. |
| **Grouping / secondary grouping** | Aggregate data by one or two dimensions. |
| **Interval** | Bucket by time interval where supported. |
| **Widgets** | Visual components built from report headers/groupings. |
| **Exports** | Background generation of CSV/XLSX/PDF/other supported formats. |

## Permissions

Access is permission-based and scoped:

- View default reports.
- View/create/edit/delete custom reports.
- Create/edit/delete widgets.
- Create scheduled reports.

## Export Model

Exports are tracked as report export records and may run asynchronously. Download links are signed and progress is available from the exports listing.
