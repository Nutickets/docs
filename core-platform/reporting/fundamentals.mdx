## Overview

Reporting gives you access to detailed operational data across events, orders, customers, finances, attendance, and more. You can view data in the browser, customise which fields appear and how results are grouped, export to spreadsheets, and automate delivery on a schedule.

Reports are organised into two tiers:

- **Default reports** are pre-built report templates covering common scenarios — event sales by ticket type, completed orders, attendance summaries, and dozens more. They are ready to use immediately and serve as the starting point for any analysis.
- **Custom reports** are your own saved configurations built on top of default reports. When you adjust filters, select specific fields, or change groupings, you can save those settings as a custom report to reuse later. Custom reports also unlock [widgets](/core-platform/reporting/custom-reports#widgets) and [scheduling](/core-platform/reporting/scheduled-reports).

## Report Categories

Reports are grouped by category on the reports listing page. The categories you see depend on which features are enabled for your account.

## Navigating the Reports Section

The reports section has three main areas, accessible from the top of the reports listing page:

- **Reports** — Browse and open default reports and your custom reports. Use the search bar to find custom reports by name.
- **Report Exports** — View the history of all exported report files. Download completed exports or check the progress of exports still being generated.
- **Scheduled Reports** — View and manage automated report schedules that deliver exports on a recurring basis.

<Note>
Each of these areas requires its own permission. If you cannot see one of these sections, check that your role has the appropriate reporting permissions assigned.

## Permissions

Access to reporting features is controlled through [roles and permissions](/core-platform/system-access/roles-and-permissions). The key permissions are:

| Permission | What it controls |
|------------|-----------------|
| **View default reports** | Access to the pre-built report templates |
| **View custom reports** | Access to saved custom report configurations |
| **Create custom reports** | Ability to save new custom reports from default report templates |
| **Edit custom reports** | Ability to modify existing custom report settings |
| **Delete custom reports** | Ability to remove custom reports |
| **Create widgets** | Ability to add chart widgets to custom reports |
| **View scheduled reports** | Access to the scheduled reports listing |
| **Create scheduled reports** | Ability to set up automated report delivery |

Reports are also scoped by your company and visibility group access. Two users with the same report open may see different data if their access is scoped to different companies or visibility groups.
