## Overview

The platform supports multi-language experiences across the ticket shop, admin area, and all customer-facing communications. Translations work at two levels:

- **Content translations** — fields like event names, descriptions, and sale item labels can be entered in each of your supported languages. When a customer browses in Spanish, they see the Spanish version of your event name; in English, they see the English version.
- **Website text overrides** — the platform's built-in interface text (button labels, email templates, legal pages, and shop copy) can be customised per company. You can change the default wording, translate it into additional languages, or tailor it for specific events, schedules, or customer groups.

Both levels combine so that customers receive a consistent experience in their chosen language — from the event listing through to checkout and email confirmations.

## Setting Up Languages

Before translating content, configure which languages your company supports.

### Adding Languages

Languages are managed at the company level. Navigate to your company settings and add the languages you want to support. The platform supports over 30 languages, including right-to-left languages such as Arabic and Hebrew.

<Accordion title="Available languages">
| Language | Locale |
|----------|--------|
| English | en |
| English (US) | en_US |
| Spanish | es |
| Spanish (Mexico) | es_MX |
| French | fr |
| French (Canada) | fr_CA |
| German | de |
| Italian | it |
| Portuguese | pt |
| Dutch | nl |
| Danish | da |
| Norwegian | no |
| Swedish | sv |
| Finnish | fi |
| Faroese | fo |
| Hungarian | hu |
| Greek | el |
| Slovenian | sl |
| Croatian | hr |
| Turkish | tr |
| Polish | pl |
| Czech | cs |
| Latvian | lv |
| Estonian | et |
| Arabic | ar |
| Hebrew | he |
| Hindi | hi |
| Chinese (Simplified) | zh |
| Chinese (Traditional) | zh_tw |
| Japanese | ja |
| Korean | ko |
| Khmer | km |
| Malay | ms |
| Tagalog | tl |
| Welsh | cy |

Arabic and Hebrew are right-to-left (RTL) languages. The platform automatically adjusts the layout direction when these languages are active.

### Fallback Language

One of your configured languages is designated as the **fallback language**. This is the primary language used when:

- A translation is not available in the customer's chosen language
- A new field is created and only one language version is entered
- The system needs a default value to display

To change the fallback language, update the setting in your company configuration.

<Note>
The fallback language is separate from the default display language. It determines which translation is used as a last resort when content hasn't been translated into the customer's current language.
</Note>

## How Customers Choose Their Language

Customers can switch languages on the ticket shop, and the platform remembers their preference across visits. The language is determined in this order:

1. **Language selector** — if the customer explicitly switches language using the shop's language picker or a `?language=` URL parameter
2. **Saved preference** — returning customers see the language they last selected (stored via cookie for guests, or saved to their account for logged-in customers)
3. **Domain-based language** — if you use language-specific domains (e.g., `fr.example.com` for French), the domain determines the language automatically
4. **Browser language** — the platform checks the customer's browser language and uses it if it matches one of your supported languages
5. **Fallback language** — your company's configured fallback language

Once a customer selects a language, it persists for one year via a browser cookie. Logged-in customers have their preference saved to their account, so it follows them across devices.

### Language-Specific Domains

You can assign different custom domains to different languages. When a customer visits a language-specific domain, the shop is automatically displayed in that language. This is useful for running country-specific storefronts (e.g. a `.de` domain for German, a `.fr` domain for French) or for SEO optimisation for different language markets. If a language does not have its own domain, it uses the company's primary domain.

### Admin and Email Languages

Admin users can independently select their preferred language for the admin panel. This is stored per user per company, so you can use a different language when working in different companies. Changing language in the admin area does not affect the shop, and vice versa.

Email communications are sent in the language configured for the relevant context — the customer's selected language for customer-facing emails, or the admin user's language for internal notifications.

## Translating Content Fields

Many entities across the platform support translated fields. When editing these entities, you'll see a language switcher that lets you enter content in each of your configured languages.

### What Can Be Translated

| Entity | Translatable fields |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Events** | Name, description |
| **Sale items** | Name, description, and other label fields |
| **Timeslots** | Name |
| **Venues** | Name, address, postcode, region |
| **Categories** | Name |
| **Tags** | Name |
| **Articles** | Name, URL slug, subheading, meta title, meta description |
| **Article content blocks** | Title, content |
| **Event content blocks** | Title, content |
| **Event blocks** | Name, description |
| **Listings/pages** | Name, subheading, body, meta title, meta description |
| **Discount codes** | Description |
| **Data capture questions** | Question text, description |
| **Data capture question options** | Value, description |
| **Fee groups** | Name |
| **Seating plan tags** | Name, description |
| **Schedule groups** | Name |

### How Translated Fields Work

When you edit a translatable field:

1. Select the language from the language switcher on the field
2. Enter the content for that language
3. Repeat for each language you want to support

If a field doesn't have a translation for the customer's current language, the platform falls back to the fallback language. If that's also empty, it falls back to English.

<Note>
You don't need to translate every field into every language. The fallback chain ensures content always displays — untranslated fields show the fallback language version. Focus on translating the most customer-facing content first: event names, descriptions, and sale item labels.
</Note>

## Translatable Images

Images can also vary by language. Entities that support translatable images include:

| Entity | Translatable images |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Events** | Page header, card thumbnail, meta/sharing image |
| **Articles** | Meta/sharing image |
| **Listings/pages** | Header, meta/sharing image |
| **Company settings** | Logo (dark and light), meta/sharing image, default event header, default event thumbnail, default sharing image, default schedule header, default item image |

When uploading an image, use the language switcher to upload a different version for each language. If no language-specific image is uploaded, the default (fallback language) image is used.

## Customising Website Text

Beyond translations, you can override specific text throughout the shop — button labels, email content, legal pages, and more — using the **Website Text** editor. Overrides can be applied globally or scoped to specific events, schedules, or customer groups, with a priority system that ensures the most specific override wins.

For full details on creating overrides, scoping them, and understanding priority resolution, see [Website Text](/core-platform/cms/website-text).

## Company Settings Translations

Several company-level settings also support translations:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **Business name** | Your company's display name |
| **Business website** | Your company's website URL |
| **Marketing preferences header** | Header text on marketing email opt-in |
| **Marketing preferences body** | Body text on marketing email opt-in |
| **Footer imprint** | Legal imprint text in the shop footer |
| **Manual payment invoice title** | Title on manual payment invoices |
| **Manual payment receipt title** | Title on manual payment receipts |
| **Manual payment instructions** | Instructions shown for manual payments |

These fields use the same language switcher as content fields, allowing you to provide localised versions for each of your supported languages.
