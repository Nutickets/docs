title: "Timezones"
description: "Understand how event, sale, and display times are interpreted using company and event timezone settings."

## Overview

- Timezone handling is first-class across events, timeslots, sale periods, and validity windows.
- Event-linked entities inherit or resolve timezone context from their parent event/company.
- Timezone-aware casts are used for persisted datetime fields.

## Practical Guidance

- Set company default timezone carefully before high-volume configuration work.
- Confirm event timezone before creating timeslots, sales periods, and validity windows.
- Review timezone display options where customer-facing timezone text is enabled.
