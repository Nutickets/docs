## Overview

Audit logs record a detailed history of every change made across the platform. Whenever a record is created, updated, deleted, or restored — whether through the admin area, hub, API, box office, or kiosk — the platform captures who made the change, what changed, and when.

This gives you full traceability for:

- **Investigating changes** — find out who modified an event's pricing, updated a customer's details, or changed a setting
- **Compliance and accountability** — maintain a clear record of administrative actions across your organisation
- **Troubleshooting** — review the timeline of changes around an incident or unexpected behaviour

Audit logging is always active and cannot be disabled. Every entity in the platform — events, orders, sale items, users, settings, and more — is automatically tracked.

## Viewing Audit Logs

Audit logs are available in both the **admin area** and the **hub**. Navigate to **Audit logs** in the sidebar to access the full audit log list.

<Note>
Viewing audit logs requires the appropriate permission. If you don't see **Audit logs** in the sidebar, contact your administrator about your role's permissions.
</Note>

### The Audit Log List

The list displays all audit entries visible to you, sorted with the most recent entries first. Each row shows:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **ID** | Unique identifier for the audit entry |
| **Description** | The type of change: **created**, **updated**, **deleted**, or **restored** |
| **Subject type** | The type of record that was changed (e.g., events, users, sale items) |
| **Subject ID** | The ID of the specific record that was changed |
| **Causer** | The user who made the change |
| **Context** | Where the change was made: Admin, Hub, API, Box Office, or Kiosk |
| **Created at** | When the change occurred (displayed in UTC) |

All columns are sortable — click a column header to sort ascending or descending.

### Filtering Audit Logs

Use the filters at the top of the list to narrow down results. You can combine multiple filters:

| Filter | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **ID** | Find a specific audit entry by its ID |
| **Subject ID** | Find all changes to a specific record (e.g., event ID 456) |
| **Subject type** | Show only changes to a particular type of record (e.g., only events, only users) |
| **Event** | Filter by the type of change: Created, Updated, Deleted, or Restored |
| **User** | Show only changes made by a specific user |
| **Context** | Filter by where the change originated (Admin, Hub, API, Box Office, Kiosk) |
| **Created at** | Filter by date range, with preset options for common time periods |
| **Company** | Filter by company (available in the hub when managing multiple companies) |
| **Show only deleted** | Toggle to show only soft-deleted audit entries |

### Viewing from an Entity Page

Many entity pages include a **View audit history** link that takes you directly to the audit log filtered for that specific record. For example, from a user's profile page you can click **View audit history** to see all changes made to that user.

## Viewing Audit Details

Click any audit entry in the list to view its full details. The detail view shows:

- **All columns** from the list view (ID, description, subject, causer, context, timestamp)
- **Properties** — a detailed breakdown of exactly what changed

### Understanding the Properties

The properties section shows the change data in two parts:

| Section | What it contains |
|---------|-----------------|
| **attributes** | The new values after the change |
| **old** | The previous values before the change (only for updates) |

For **created** events, you'll see all the initial values under **attributes** with no **old** section. For **updated** events, both sections appear so you can compare before and after. For **deleted** events, the previous values are captured under **old**.

<Note>
Sensitive fields such as passwords, API keys, and encrypted data are masked with **\*\*\*\*\*** in audit logs. This prevents sensitive information from being exposed in the audit trail.
</Note>

## Deleting and Restoring Audit Entries

Audit entries can be soft-deleted if you have the appropriate permission. A deleted entry is hidden from the default list view but is not permanently removed.

### Deleting an Entry

Click the delete button on an audit entry in the list. The entry is soft-deleted and hidden from the standard view.

### Restoring a Deleted Entry

1. Enable the **Show only deleted** filter to see soft-deleted entries
2. Click the restore button on the entry you want to recover

<Note>
Deleting an audit entry removes it from the default list view — it does not undo the original change. Audit deletion is itself an administrative action for managing the audit log, not a way to revert changes.
</Note>

## What Is Tracked

The platform automatically tracks changes to all core entities, including but not limited to:

| Category | Entities tracked |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Events & venues** | Events, event settings, event blocks, timeslots, zones, venues, event media |
| **Sales & pricing** | Sale items, sale item groups, pricing, price bands, discount codes, tax bands |
| **Orders & transactions** | Orders, order items, item transfers, transactions, wallet transactions |
| **Users & access** | Users, roles, permissions |
| **Content** | Articles, article blocks, event content blocks, listings, tags, forms |
| **Customers** | Customer records, customer groups, merged customers |
| **Configuration** | Company settings, webhooks, custom URLs, language overrides |
| **Seating** | Seating plans, revisions, areas, seats, blocks, rows, tables |
| **Financial** | Invoices, invoice line items, settlements, fees, wallets |
| **Resale** | Resale listings, contracts, settings |

### Change Contexts

Each audit entry records the context in which the change was made:

| Context | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Changes made through the admin area |
| **Hub** | Changes made through the hub |
| **API** | Changes made via the public API |
| **Box Office** | Changes made through the box office interface |
| **Kiosk** | Changes made through a kiosk |

<Note>
Changes made in the customer-facing ticket shop (e.g., a customer placing an order) are recorded but are not displayed in the audit log interface. The audit log focuses on administrative and operational changes.
</Note>

## Impersonation

When an administrator impersonates another user and makes changes while impersonated, the audit log attributes those changes to the **original administrator** — not the user being impersonated. This ensures accountability is maintained even when using impersonation for support or debugging purposes.

## Permissions

Access to audit logs is controlled through four permissions:

| Permission | What it allows |
|------------|---------------|
| **View** | View the audit log list and individual entries |
| **Delete** | Soft-delete audit entries |
| **Restore** | Restore soft-deleted audit entries |

Audit logs are also scoped by company. Admin users see audit entries for their company and any child companies. Hub users see entries relevant to their managed companies.
