## Overview

The basket is where customers collect tickets and products before checking out. When a customer adds items, those items are **reserved** -- stock is held so no one else can purchase the same seats or limited inventory. A countdown timer shows how long the reservation lasts, and when the timer expires, items are released back to inventory for other customers.

Beyond holding items, the basket is the place where customers enter discount codes, apply access codes, and (optionally) are guided through an upsell wizard before proceeding to checkout.

Several company settings control basket behaviour. This page walks through each one and explains how they affect the customer experience.

## Basket Timeout

Every basket has a countdown timer. When items are added, the timer starts and the customer has a fixed window to complete checkout before their reserved items are released.

### Configuring the Timeout

Set the timeout duration in **General Settings** under **Basket timeout (in minutes)**.

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Default** | 10 minutes |
| **Maximum** | 60 minutes |

Choose a timeout that balances urgency (shorter timers reduce stock-holding conflicts) with customer convenience (longer timers suit complex orders or slow connections).

### Timer Extensions

Customers can extend their basket timer during checkout if it is about to expire. Extensions are offered automatically when the timer falls below one minute.

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Maximum extensions** | 3 per basket |
| **Extension trigger** | Timer is within 1 minute of expiry |
| **Total maximum hold time** | 3 x the configured basket timeout |

For example, with a 10-minute timeout, a customer who uses all three extensions can hold items for up to 30 minutes.

### What Happens When a Basket Expires

When the timer reaches zero, all items are released back to inventory. The customer sees **"Your basket is empty"** along with one of these messages:

| Scenario | Message |
|----------|---------|
| All items can be recovered | "Unfortunately your basket has expired, but your items are saved." |
| Some items can be recovered | "Unfortunately your basket has expired, but some of your items are saved." |

The customer can click **Rebuild basket** to attempt recovery. The system tries to re-reserve each item and reports the result:

| Outcome | Message |
|---------|---------|
| Full recovery | "All of your previous basket items were restored." |
| Partial recovery | "Some of your previous order was recovered -- some items may have been out of stock, so were not added." |
| No recovery | "The items that you've attempted to recover are no longer available." |

<Note>
Recovery depends on current stock availability. If another customer purchased the same items while the basket was expired, those items cannot be recovered.
</Note>

## Basket Size Limit

You can cap the number of items a single basket can contain.

Configure this in **Company Settings** under **Basket size limit**. This setting optionally overrides the default and applies only to the ticket shop -- it is **not** enforced in box office.

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **System maximum** | 300 items |
| **Default display limit** | 50 items |
| **Custom limit** | Set per-company via the setting |

<Note>
The basket size limit does not apply to box office orders. Box office staff can add items beyond the configured limit.
</Note>

## Global Basket (Multi-Event Purchasing)

By default, customers can add items from **multiple events** into a single basket and check out once. This is called the global basket.

Configure this in **Company Settings** under **Enable global basket**.

### When Enabled (Default)

Customers freely add tickets and products from different events into one basket. All items appear together and are purchased in a single checkout.

### When Disabled

Customers can only hold items from **one event** at a time. If they try to add items from a different event, a modal appears:

> "You already have items in your basket from a different event. Please finish your previous purchase before trying to purchase new items."

The modal offers two choices:

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Finish current order** | Returns to the existing basket |
| **Start a new order** | Clears the basket and starts fresh with the new event |

<Warning>
Global basket **cannot** be enabled when event-level tracking pixels are configured. The toggle is disabled with the message: "Global basket cannot be turned on when tracking pixels are enabled." Remove event-level tracking pixels before enabling global basket.
</Warning>

## Forced Checkout

Forced checkout prevents customers from navigating away from the checkout flow once they have items in their basket, reducing abandoned carts.

Configure this in **Company Settings** under **Enable forced checkout**.

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Availability** | Only when global basket is **disabled** |
| **Scope** | Ticket shop only -- does not apply in box office |

<Note>
Forced checkout and global basket are mutually exclusive. You cannot enable both at the same time. If global basket is enabled, the forced checkout toggle is disabled with the message: "Forced checkout is only available when global basket is disabled."
</Note>

### How It Works

When a customer with items in their basket tries to navigate to any other page, a confirmation modal appears:

- **Title:** "Are you sure?"
- **Message:** "Are you sure you want to leave checkout? Your selected items will be removed from your basket and may not be available later."

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Leave checkout** | Clears the basket and navigates away |
| **Continue checkout** | Stays on the checkout page |

## Discount Codes

Customers can enter discount codes directly in the basket to reduce their order total.

The discount code field is controlled by the **Show discount input** setting in **Company Settings**. When enabled, the basket displays: "If you have a discount code, please enter it in the box below" with an **Apply** button.

| Event | What the customer sees |
|-------|----------------------|
| Code applied successfully | "We have applied your discount code to your order." with a **Discount Applied** badge |
| Code removed | The discount is removed and the basket total recalculates |

Customers can remove applied discount codes individually if they change their mind.

For creating and managing discount codes, see [Discount Codes](/core-platform/basket-codes/discount-codes).

## Access Codes

Access codes work differently from discount codes -- rather than reducing prices, they **unlock hidden sale items** that are not otherwise visible in the shop.

The access code field is controlled by the **Show access code input** setting in **Company Settings**. When enabled, customers can enter their code in the basket or via the **Profile** icon in the menu.

The basket displays: "If you have an access code, please enter it in the box below to unlock additional items." with an **Apply** button.

| Event | What the customer sees |
|-------|----------------------|
| Code applied successfully | "We have applied your access code to your order." with an **Access Code Applied** badge |
| Invalid code | "The access code specified is invalid." |

<Note>
Access codes unlock items -- they do not apply a price discount. Once an access code is applied, previously hidden sale items become available for the customer to browse and add to their basket.
</Note>

For creating and managing access codes, see [Access Codes](/core-platform/basket-codes/access-codes).

## Upsell Wizard

The upsell wizard encourages customers to consider additional products and donations after they add items to their basket, before they proceed to checkout.

Configure this in **Company Settings** under **Enable upsell wizard**.

### How It Works

When enabled, adding items to the basket triggers a guided wizard that presents relevant non-ticket items such as merchandise, food and drink packages, or donation options. The customer can:

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Add & checkout** | Adds the selected upsell items and proceeds to checkout |
| **Skip & checkout** | Skips the upsell suggestions and proceeds directly to checkout |

## Basket Page Layout

The basket page shows customers everything they need before checking out:

- **Title:** "Your basket"
- Each item with its name, quantity, and price
- Running order total
- Discount code and access code sections (if enabled)
- Countdown timer
- **Checkout** button

When the basket is empty, customers see **"Your basket is empty."** with an empty basket icon.

<Accordion title="Basket during order modification">
When a customer is modifying an existing order, the basket page adapts:

- **Title** changes to "Edit your order #REF" (where REF is the order reference)
- **Checkout button** changes to "Check out changes"
- An informational message is displayed: "Your previous order is still active, and won't be cancelled until you check out your current changes. If your basket times out no changes will be made."

The original order remains untouched until the customer completes checkout with the modified items. If the basket expires during modification, no changes are applied to the original order.
</Accordion>
