## Overview

The homepage is the first thing customers see when they visit your ticket shop URL. It is a fully configurable landing page built using the [CMS page system](/core-platform/cms/pages) — you control the header style, the content blocks that appear, and how events and articles are displayed.

Behind the scenes, the homepage is a **listing page** with its URL set to `/` (the root of your shop). You compose it by adding and arranging [content blocks](/core-platform/cms/blocks) in the admin page editor, choosing from event blocks, article blocks, and template blocks.

<Note>
If no listing page exists for the root URL (`/`), customers are automatically redirected to the events browse page instead. You do not need a homepage to run your shop, but having one gives you full control over the first impression.

## Creating Your Homepage

1. Navigate to **CMS > Pages**
2. Create a new listing page (or edit an existing one)
3. Set the **URL** to `/` to make it the homepage
4. Choose a [header style](/core-platform/cms/pages#header-styles) to set the visual presentation
5. Add [content blocks](/core-platform/cms/blocks) to populate the page with events, articles, or custom content

## Building an Effective Homepage

A well-built homepage typically combines several block types to create a layered experience. For example:

1. A **full-width image header** as a hero banner with a welcome message
2. A **featured-style event block** highlighting your top upcoming events
3. A **template block** with a promotional banner or call to action
4. A **three-column event block** sourced from a specific tag, showing events in a particular category
5. An **article block** with recently published news or blog posts
6. A **slider event block** with recently added events for customers to browse

There is no fixed formula — the block system is flexible enough to suit everything from a single-event page to a content-rich magazine-style landing page with carousels, maps, and editorial content.

<Note>
Event block results are cached with a 15-minute TTL. After you publish a new event or change event details, it may take up to 15 minutes for those changes to appear in event blocks on the homepage.
