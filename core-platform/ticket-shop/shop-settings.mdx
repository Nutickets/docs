## Overview

Shop settings are the environment-level controls that affect the entire ticket shop -- not a single event, basket, or checkout step, but the overall shopping experience every customer encounters. These include the virtual waiting room for managing high-demand traffic, cookie consent and privacy controls, SEO and search engine indexing, analytics integration, and how dates and times are displayed.

Most of these settings live in **General Settings** under your admin panel, while the waiting room is configured through the **theme editor**. This page walks through each setting area and explains how it affects your customers.

## Virtual Waiting Room

The virtual waiting room is a queue system that manages traffic during high-demand on-sale periods. When your shop reaches its capacity limit, incoming customers are placed in a queue and admitted automatically as space becomes available. This prevents your shop from becoming overloaded and ensures customers already browsing can complete their purchases without degraded performance.

### Enabling and Configuring the Waiting Room

Configure the waiting room in the admin theme editor under **Waiting room settings**:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Enable virtual waiting room** | Turns the waiting room on or off | Enabled |
| **Maximum number of simultaneous shoppers** | How many customers can browse the shop at once before queuing begins | 200 |
| **Maximum inactivity time in minutes** | How long an inactive customer holds their spot before being removed from the shop | 5 minutes |
| **Maximum position hold time in minutes** | The longest any customer can hold their spot, even if they remain active | 60 minutes |

<Note>
The maximum queue size is **5,000 users**. Users beyond this limit will not be able to join the queue. If you expect demand to exceed this, consider staggering your on-sale times across multiple events.
</Note>

### How Capacity Is Tracked

Each active shopper is tracked by their browser session. When a customer closes their browser or becomes inactive for longer than the configured inactivity timeout, their spot is released and the next person in the queue is admitted.

The **maximum position hold time** acts as an upper bound -- even an active customer who has been browsing for longer than this limit will have their spot released. This prevents a single session from occupying capacity indefinitely during extended browsing.

### What Customers See in the Queue

When a customer arrives and the shop is at capacity, they are placed in the queue and see a waiting room page with:

- Their current position in the queue (e.g. "You are currently in position 42")
- A message explaining the situation: "Due to high levels of interest in these events, we've had to place you in a queue"
- Guidance to keep the page open: "Hold tight, you'll automatically be returned to the ticket shop once the people ahead of you have finished what they are doing. We recommend keeping this page open to secure your spot."

The page automatically checks for updates and redirects the customer into the shop as soon as a spot opens. Customers do not need to refresh manually.

### Queue Polling Intervals

The waiting room page checks for updates at different frequencies depending on the customer's position in the queue. Customers closer to the front receive more frequent updates:

| Queue Position | Check Frequency |
|----------------|-----------------|
| 1 -- 50 | Every 15 seconds |
| 51 -- 200 | Every 20 seconds |
| 201 -- 1,000 | Every 30 seconds |
| 1,001 -- 2,000 | Every 60 seconds |
| Beyond 2,000 | Every 90 seconds |

A small amount of random variance (jitter) is added to each interval to prevent synchronised request waves, where thousands of browsers all check at the exact same moment.

### Customising Waiting Room Text

All text displayed on the waiting room page -- headings, queue messages, and guidance text -- can be customised through the CMS text editor. This lets you match the tone and branding of your shop, or add event-specific messaging during a major on-sale.

<Note>
If you are running a high-demand on-sale, consider lowering the **maximum inactivity time** to free up spots faster from customers who have navigated away, and review your **maximum simultaneous shoppers** limit based on your expected traffic.
</Note>

## Cookie Banner and Policy

The cookie banner gives customers control over which cookies your shop sets, helping you meet privacy requirements. When enabled, customers see a consent banner on their first visit.

### Enabling the Cookie Banner

Enable the cookie banner in **Company Settings**:

- Toggle **Enable cookies banner & policy page** to on

<Note>
All text shown on the cookie banner and policy page can be customised in the CMS text editor under the text menu. This includes the banner message, cookie descriptions, and the full policy page content.
</Note>

### Cookie Categories

The banner presents two categories of cookies:

| Category | Description | Customer Choice |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Necessary cookies** | Enable core functionality such as security, network management, and accessibility | Always active -- cannot be declined |
| **Analytics cookies** | Help improve the website by collecting and reporting information on how customers use it | Optional -- customer can accept or decline |

Customers are presented with two options:
- **Use necessary cookies** -- accepts only the cookies required for the shop to function
- **Allow all cookies** -- accepts all cookies including analytics

### Passing Cookie Preferences from Another Site

If your ticket shop is linked from a main website where the customer has already made a cookie choice, you can pass that preference through to avoid showing the banner again. Append the `cookiesAccepted` query parameter to your shop URL:

| Parameter Value | Meaning |
|-----------------|---------|
| `cookiesAccepted=0` | No previous choice -- banner will be shown |
| `cookiesAccepted=1` | Necessary cookies only |
| `cookiesAccepted=2` | All cookies accepted |

For example: `https://yourshop.com/?cookiesAccepted=2` would suppress the cookie banner and treat the customer as having accepted all cookies.

## SEO and Search Engine Indexing

These settings control how search engines discover and display your ticket shop in search results.

### Meta Tags

Configure your shop's default SEO metadata in **Company Settings**:

| Setting | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Meta title** | The page title shown in browser tabs and search engine results |
| **Meta description** | The description shown beneath the title in search engine results |

Both fields support translations, so you can set different meta content for each language your shop supports.

<Note>
Individual listing pages (CMS pages) can override these defaults with their own meta title and description. The company-level settings act as fallbacks for pages that do not have their own SEO metadata configured.
</Note>

### Disabling Search Engine Indexing

If you want to prevent search engines from indexing parts of your shop -- for example, during a staging or testing period -- use the **Disable SEO Indexing** setting in **Company Settings**.

You can disable indexing for:
- **The whole site** -- prevents search engines from indexing any page on your ticket shop
- **Individual areas** -- selectively exclude specific sections while keeping the rest indexed

When indexing is disabled for a page, a `noindex` meta tag is added to tell search engines not to include that page in their results.

<Warning>
Disabling indexing for the whole site will remove your shop from search engine results over time. Only use this for shops that are not yet live or should not be publicly discoverable.
</Warning>

### Sitemap

Your ticket shop automatically generates a sitemap at `/sitemap.xml` for search engine crawlers. The sitemap includes:

- Published events
- Listing pages (CMS pages)
- Standard shop pages

The sitemap updates automatically as events are published or unpublished -- no manual action is required. Search engines use the sitemap to discover and index your content more efficiently.

## Google Tag Manager

Integrate Google Tag Manager to add tracking, analytics, and marketing tags across your shop without modifying code.

### Setting Up Google Tag Manager

1. Navigate to **Company Settings**
2. Enter your GTM container ID in the **Google Tag Manager code** field (e.g. `GTM-XXXXXXX`)

Once configured, the GTM container is loaded on every page of your ticket shop.

<Note>
Google Tag Manager respects the cookie banner. If you have the cookie banner enabled, analytics and marketing tags configured in GTM will only fire after the customer has accepted analytics cookies. This ensures your tracking complies with the customer's consent choice.
</Note>

## Date and Time Display

These settings control how dates and times appear to customers throughout the shop -- on event pages, in the basket, on tickets, and anywhere else a date or time is shown.

Configure these in **General Settings**:

| Setting | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Date display setting** | Controls the date format used across the shop (e.g. DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY, or other regional formats) |
| **Time display setting** | Controls the time format (e.g. 12-hour with AM/PM or 24-hour) |
| **Show timezone information** | When enabled, displays timezone information alongside dates and times in the ticket shop |

<Note>
Enabling **Show timezone information** is recommended if you sell tickets for events across multiple timezones, so customers can clearly see which timezone an event time refers to.
