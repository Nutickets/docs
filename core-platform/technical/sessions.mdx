## Overview

The platform uses sessions and cookies to maintain user state throughout a visit — keeping track of login status, basket contents, language preferences, and currency selections. Understanding how sessions work is especially important during checkout, where a countdown timer governs how long items are held in the basket.

## Basket Timers

When a customer adds items to their basket, a countdown timer begins. This timer ensures that reserved items are released back to availability if the customer doesn't complete their purchase within the allowed time.

### How the Timer Works

- The countdown starts when items are added to the basket and is visible during checkout.
- The timer resets each time the basket is modified (items added or removed).
- When the timer expires, the basket is cleared and items are released for other customers to purchase.

### Configuring the Basket Timeout

The basket timeout duration is configurable per company:

1. Navigate to your company settings.
2. Find **Basket timeout (in minutes)**.
3. Set the desired timeout duration.

The default timeout is **10 minutes**. This applies to all orders within the company.

<Note>
If a customer has a payment link and modifies their basket, it resets the expiry date back to the default basket timeout. The platform warns: **If the customer modifies their basket, it will reset the expiry date back down to the default basket timeout. This could cause some items to be released sooner than anticipated.**
</Note>

### When Time Runs Low

When the countdown reaches **30 seconds remaining**, a warning modal appears with the message: **Your time is almost up!**

The modal reassures the customer: **Looks like your reservation is about to expire — but don't worry! Your tickets remain safe in the basket while the countdown is active.**

Customers have two options:

- **I need more time** — Extends the basket timer by the configured timeout duration
- **Continue checkout** — Dismisses the modal and returns to checkout

<Note>
Basket time can be extended a **maximum of 3 times**. After the third extension, the **I need more time** option is no longer available and the basket will expire when the timer reaches zero.
</Note>

### Basket Expiry

When the timer reaches zero, the basket expires and the customer sees: **Unfortunately your basket has expired, but your items are saved.**

Behind the scenes, the platform runs an automatic process every minute to expire baskets that have passed their timeout. When a basket expires:

- Reserved items are released back to available stock
- Any pending payment transactions are cancelled
- If the basket was part of an order modification, the original order is restored

### Recovering an Expired Basket

If a customer's basket expires, they can attempt to recover it. Recovery creates a new basket with the same items as the expired one, subject to availability — if any items have been purchased by another customer in the interim, those items will not be included in the recovered basket.

<Note>
Basket recovery is only available for the most recently expired basket. If the customer starts a new basket and that one also expires, only the latest expired basket can be recovered.
</Note>

## Session Expiry

Each user session lasts for **120 minutes** of inactivity. After this period, the session expires and the user must log in again. If a session expires while the user is on a page, submitting a form may display a **page expired** message — refreshing the page and logging in again resolves this.

<Note>
The session timeout (120 minutes) is separate from the basket timeout. A session can expire after the user has completed checkout, without affecting their completed order. Conversely, a basket can expire while the session is still active.
</Note>

## Logging In

When a customer logs in, their session is refreshed with a new identifier for security. Any items in the basket and any waiting room position are automatically carried over to the new session — customers do not lose their place or their basket contents when logging in during checkout.
