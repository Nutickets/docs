## Overview

The platform is designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that users with diverse needs — including those using screen readers, keyboard-only navigation, or assistive technologies — can navigate and interact with the product. Accessibility features are built into the platform's core components and are available to all users by default.

## Keyboard Navigation

All interactive elements — buttons, links, form fields, dropdowns, and modals — are operable using a keyboard. The following patterns are used throughout the platform:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Tab** | Move focus to the next interactive element |
| **Shift + Tab** | Move focus to the previous interactive element |
| **Enter** | Activate the focused button or link |
| **Space** | Toggle checkboxes, activate buttons, or select items |
| **Escape** | Close modals, dropdowns, and overlays |
| **Arrow keys** | Navigate within dropdowns, select lists, and date pickers |

### Skip to Main Content

A **Skip to main content** link appears at the top of each page when a user presses **Tab**. Activating this link moves focus directly to the main content area, allowing keyboard users to bypass the site header and navigation on every page.

## Screen Reader Support

The platform uses semantic HTML and ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to provide meaningful context to screen readers:

- **Buttons and links** include descriptive labels, even when the visible text is an icon. Screen reader-only text (visually hidden but announced by assistive technology) provides context for icon-only controls.
- **Form fields** are associated with their labels, ensuring screen readers announce what each field is for.
- **Decorative elements** — icons, images, and visual separators that don't convey meaning — are hidden from screen readers to reduce noise.
- **Dynamic components** such as accordions, dropdown menus, and tooltips communicate their current state (expanded, collapsed, selected) through ARIA attributes.

## Focus Management

Visible focus indicators highlight which element is currently selected, making it clear where keyboard input will be directed. Focus is managed carefully in interactive patterns:

- **Modals** trap focus within the dialog while open, preventing users from accidentally tabbing to content behind the overlay. When a modal closes, focus returns to the element that opened it.
- **Dropdowns** return focus to the triggering element when closed.
- **Form validation** directs focus to error messages when submissions fail.

## Accessible Forms

Form components across the platform follow accessible patterns:

- **Labels** are explicitly linked to their inputs, so screen readers announce the field name when the input is focused.
- **Fieldsets and legends** group related inputs (such as radio buttons or checkbox sets) with a shared description.
- **Toggle switches** announce their current state — on or off — using ARIA attributes, so users who cannot see the visual indicator still know the setting's value.
- **Error messages** are associated with their fields so assistive technology can announce validation errors in context.

## Seating Plans

For events with assigned seating, the platform provides an accessibility filter to help users find suitable seats:

- The **Space Accessibility** filter, labelled **Show accessible seats**, highlights seats designated as accessible within the venue map.

<Note>
Accessible seat availability depends on how the venue's seating plan has been configured. The filter only appears when accessible seats have been defined in the seating plan.

The cookie consent banner is fully accessible — it can be navigated and activated using the keyboard, and its content is readable by screen readers. See [Sessions & Cookies](/core-platform/technical/sessions) for details on the cookie banner and cookie types.
