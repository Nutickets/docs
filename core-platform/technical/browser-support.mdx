## Overview

The platform is built on modern web technologies and works best with current versions of major browsers. An automatic compatibility check runs when users visit the site — those on unsupported browsers are redirected to a guidance page before they encounter errors.

## Supported Browsers

The platform supports the latest versions of:

- **Google Chrome**
- **Mozilla Firefox**
- **Microsoft Edge**

**Safari** is supported for general use, but has known limitations with certain features (see [Browser-Specific Considerations](#browser-specific-considerations) below).

<Note>
The platform requires JavaScript to be enabled. Users with JavaScript disabled see a banner prompting them to enable it or use another device.

## Unsupported Browser Detection

When a user visits the platform, an automatic compatibility check runs in the background. If the browser lacks support for essential JavaScript features, the user is redirected to an **Unsupported browser** page.

This page displays:

- The message: **It looks like you are using a browser version that we don't support. Try upgrading your browser to get the full experience.**
- Download links for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge

The check targets very old browsers (such as Internet Explorer) that cannot run the platform's JavaScript framework. Modern versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari all pass this check.

## Browser-Specific Considerations

| Browser | Consideration |
|---------|---------------|
| **Safari** | Can experience issues with images in certain features. When uploading seating plan images, the platform displays: **Safari can experience issues with images. We recommend using an alternative browser, e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Edge.** |
| **Older browsers** | Browsers that don't support WebP image format will see a recommendation when saving images: **Your current browser doesn't support webP. We highly recommend that you upload your images in a different browser, like Chrome or Firefox.** |

## Mobile Devices

The platform is fully responsive and adapts to all screen sizes, from small phones to tablets and desktops. No separate mobile app or URL is needed — users access the same platform URL from any device.
