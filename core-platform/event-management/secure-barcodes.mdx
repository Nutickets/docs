description: "Replace static QR codes with dynamic barcodes that rotate over time, preventing ticket fraud from screenshots and barcode sharing."

## Overview

Static QR codes can be screenshotted, forwarded, or posted online — anyone with the image can attempt entry. Secure barcodes solve this by replacing the static code with a dynamically-generated barcode that rotates periodically. Because the code changes, a screenshot taken minutes ago is already invalid.

When secure barcodes are active on an event:
- Customers see a rotating QR code in their account instead of a static barcode
- PDF ticket downloads are blocked for customers (the code would be static on paper)
- Apple Wallet passes remain available
- Scanning is performed via the [Access Control Pro](/mobile-apps/access-control-pro/introduction) app

Secure barcodes apply to **tickets** and **season tickets** on events. Shop products and non-event items are not affected.

## Enabling Secure Barcodes

Secure barcodes are controlled by two settings: a company-level feature flag and an event-level scanning mode.

### Feature Flag

Your account must have the **Dynamic QR Codes** feature enabled. Contact support if you do not see the secure barcode options described below.

### Event Scanning Mode

Once the feature is available on your account, enable secure barcodes per event:

1. Open the event dashboard
2. Navigate to the scanning mode setting
3. Select **Secure QR Only**

The system begins generating secure seeds for all eligible order items in the background. This runs as a batched job (processing 200 items at a time), so there may be a short delay before all items are ready.

<Note>
The scanning mode setting is also covered in [Access Control — Scanning Mode](/core-platform/event-management/access-control#scanning-mode). Changing the scanning mode only affects how the mobile app reads tickets — admission through the admin panel is not affected.
</Note>

## What Customers See

When secure barcodes are active, the customer experience changes in two ways:

**Dynamic QR code** — Instead of a static barcode, customers see a rotating QR code in their account. This code regenerates periodically and cannot be meaningfully screenshotted or shared.

**No PDF download** — The PDF download option is removed. If a customer attempts to download, they see the message: *"These tickets have secure barcodes"*. Apple Wallet downloads remain available.

## Managing Secure Barcodes on Orders

Admins can manage secure barcodes at the individual order item level from the order detail page. Each item with an active secure barcode displays a green **Secure Barcode** badge.

### Disabling Secure Barcodes on an Item

To convert an individual item back to a static barcode:

1. Open the order detail page
2. Find the item with the **Secure Barcode** badge
3. Disable the secure barcode

The item reverts to a standard static barcode. The customer will see a confirmation: *"Secure barcodes have been disabled."*

<Note>
Disabling is permanent for that barcode — the static barcode generated is a new code. The confirmation warns: *"This will permanently disable the secure barcode for [item]. The barcode will become an unsecure barcode that can be copied or printed."*
</Note>

### Re-enabling Secure Barcodes on an Item

If an item was previously converted to a static barcode, you can re-enable secure barcodes:

1. Open the order detail page
2. Click **Enable Secure Barcode** on the item

A new secure seed is generated, and the previous static barcode is invalidated. The customer sees: *"Secure barcodes have been enabled."*

<Note>
Re-enabling generates a completely new barcode. Any previously downloaded or printed static barcode for that item will no longer work. The confirmation warns: *"This will generate new secure barcodes for the selected tickets. The previous unsecure barcodes will no longer work."*
</Note>

### Generating New Barcodes and Barcode History

For items that have been converted to static barcodes, you also have access to:

- **Generate New Barcode** — creates a fresh static barcode, invalidating the previous one
- **Barcode History** — view all previous barcodes generated for the item

### Frozen Orders

Secure barcode controls are locked when an order is frozen. You must unfreeze the order before enabling or disabling secure barcodes on any of its items.

## PDF Downloads for Admins

While customers cannot download PDFs when secure barcodes are active, admins can — but with a warning.

When an admin attempts to download a PDF for an order with secure barcodes, a confirmation dialog appears:

> *"These tickets have secure barcodes. Downloading as PDF will convert them to unsecure barcodes. Unsecure barcodes can be shared with other 3rd parties like resale sites. You can always re-enable secure barcodes, however that will invalidate the downloaded QR code."*

Clicking **Yes, download as PDF** proceeds with the download and converts the affected items to static barcodes. You can re-enable secure barcodes afterwards, but the downloaded PDF will no longer be valid.

## Disabling the Feature at Company Level

If the Dynamic QR Codes feature is disabled at the company level:

- All events currently set to **Secure QR Only** revert to **QR Only**
- Future order items have their secure seeds cleared
- Historical order data is preserved for reporting purposes

<Note>
This is an account-wide change. If you only want to disable secure barcodes for a specific event, change that event's scanning mode to **QR Only** instead.
</Note>

## Background Processing

Secure seed generation runs automatically in the background:

- When an event's scanning mode is set to **Secure QR Only**, seeds are generated for all eligible order items in batches of 200
- A scheduled command fills in any missing seeds for future events
- Items that already have seeds are skipped

If an event has a large number of orders, there may be a brief delay between enabling secure barcodes and all customers seeing the dynamic QR code.

<Note>
If an event is not configured for secure barcodes but an admin attempts to enable them on an individual item, the system displays: *"This event is not configured for secure barcodes."*
