## Overview

- Events can either be standalone of form part of a [schedule](/core-platform/event-scheduling/event-discovery). Both types of events can by [manually copied](/core-platform/event-management/copying-events) to create a replica standalone event.
- Event pages can be customised, see [event page customisations](/core-platform/event-management/event-page-customisations) for more details.
- An event has a single start and end date, however, entrance times can be divided up into [timeslots](/core-platform/event-management/timeslots) within the bounds of the events overall start & end date.
- All dates associated with an event, including the start/end dates, the start/end times of any timeslots within the event, the [on sale dates](/core-platform/event-management/sales-periods), as well as any dates associated with related records (such as [zones](/core-platform/access-control/zones) and [sale items](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts)), are set in the events [timezone](/core-platform/core/timezones).
- [Seating plans](/core-platform/event-management/seating-plans) may optionally be attached to an event, promoting it to a seated event.
