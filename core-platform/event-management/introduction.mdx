## Overview

- Events can either be standalone or form part of a [schedule](/core-platform/event-management/schedules). Both types of events can be [manually copied](/core-platform/event-management/copying-events) to create a replica standalone event.
- Event pages can be customised via [event page customisations](/core-platform/event-management/event-page-customisations).
- An event has a single start and end date, however, entrance times can be divided into [timeslots](/core-platform/event-management/timeslots) within the bounds of the event's overall start and end date.
- All dates associated with an event—including the start/end dates, the start/end times of any timeslots, the [on sale dates](/core-platform/event-management/sales-periods), as well as any dates associated with related records (such as [zones](/core-platform/event-management/access-control#zones) and [sale items](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts))—are set in the event's [timezone](/core-platform/core/timezones).
- [Seating plans](/core-platform/event-management/seated-events) may optionally be attached to an event, promoting it to a seated event.

## Event Types

When creating an event, you must specify its location type:

| Type         | Description                                                                                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **In Venue** | A physical event at a specific [venue](/core-platform/event-management/venues). Customers attend in person.   |
| **Online**   | A virtual event with no physical location. Supports live streaming via providers like Vimeo or YouTube.       |
| **Both**     | A hybrid event that is both in-person and streamed online. Requires both a venue and streaming configuration. |

<Note>
  Online and hybrid events can display an embedded live stream on the event
  page, with optional chat functionality for supported providers.
</Note>

## Event Status

Events progress through different statuses during their lifecycle:

| Status    | Description                                                                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Draft     | The event is not yet published. It cannot be purchased and is not visible on the shop. |
| Published | The event is live and visible to customers (unless hidden).                            |
| Off Sale  | The event is published but not currently available for purchase.                       |
| Sold Out  | The event has reached capacity or all items are unavailable.                           |
| Cancelled | The event has been cancelled. This action is irreversible.                             |

<Warning>
  Cancelling an event is irreversible. Once cancelled, the event cannot be put
  back on sale. Cancellation takes the event off sale, hides it from listings,
  and updates its status. Customers are not automatically refunded or
  notified—this must be managed separately via the event dashboard.
</Warning>

### Approval Workflow

If event approvals are enabled for your company, events may require approval before they can be published. See [event approvals](/core-platform/event-management/event-approvals) for details.

## Creating Events

Events are created through a multi-step wizard:

1. **Event Information** — Name, description, [visibility groups](/core-platform/system-access/visibility-groups), and event images
2. **Location & Dates** — Event type (in-venue/online/both), venue selection, and date/time configuration
3. **Event Codes** — Custom [data capture](/core-platform/data-capture/introduction) fields (if configured)
4. **Mandatory Tags** — Required [event tags](/core-platform/event-management/event-tags) (if configured)

<Note>
  If mandatory organiser details are enabled for your company, you must provide
  organiser name, email, and phone during event creation.
</Note>

Events can also be [created](/api-reference/events/create-event) and [updated](/api-reference/events/update-event) via the API. Use the [Retrieve Events](/api-reference/events/retrieve-events) endpoint to list events, or [Retrieve Event](/api-reference/events/retrieve-event) for a single event's details.
