title: "Access Control"
description: "Overview of how access control works for events — zones, scanning, and entry rules."

## Overview

- Access control manages how attendees are admitted to an event using barcode or NFC scanning.
- Each event has one or more **zones** — configurable areas that define scanning behaviour, capacity, and entry rules.
- A **default zone** (named "Entry") is automatically created when an event is set up. Additional zones can be added for different areas of a venue.
- The event's **scanning mode** determines which technology the mobile app uses to identify tickets (QR codes, dynamic QR codes, or NFC).
- Scanning is performed via the [Access Control Pro](/mobile-apps/access-control-pro) mobile app, the [Box Office Pro](/mobile-apps/box-office-pro) app, or [through the admin panel](/core-platform/access-control/admitting-via-admin).

## Key Concepts

- **Scanning mode** — An event-level setting controlling how the mobile app reads tickets (QR, Secure QR, or NFC). See [standard entry](/core-platform/access-control/standard-entry#scanning-mode-event-level).
- **Zones** — Configurable areas with their own scan modes, limits, capacity, eligible items, and age restrictions. See [zones](/core-platform/access-control/zones).
- **Validity dates** — Time windows controlling when a ticket is accepted for entry, configured per sale item. See [validity dates](/core-platform/access-control/validity-dates).
