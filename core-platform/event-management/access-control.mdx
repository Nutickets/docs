description: "Configure zones, scanning modes, and entry rules to manage attendee admission at your events."

## Overview

- Access control manages how attendees are admitted to an event using barcode or NFC scanning.
- Each event has one or more **zones** — configurable areas that define scanning behaviour, capacity, and entry rules.
- A **default zone** (named "Entry") is automatically created when an event is set up. Additional zones can be added for different areas of a venue.
- Scanning is performed via the [Access Control Pro](/mobile-apps/access-control-pro) mobile app, the [Box Office Pro](/mobile-apps/box-office-pro) app, or [through the admin panel](/core-platform/access-control/admitting-via-admin).
- The event's **scanning mode** determines which technology the mobile app uses to identify tickets (QR codes, dynamic QR codes, or NFC).

## Scanning Mode

The scanning mode is an event-level setting that controls how the [Access Control Pro](/mobile-apps/access-control-pro) app reads tickets. It is configured from the event dashboard.

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **QR Only** | Scans standard QR codes and barcodes printed on tickets or displayed in the customer's account. |
| **Secure QR Only** | Scans time-based dynamic QR codes that rotate periodically, preventing screenshot sharing. See [secure barcodes](/core-platform/advanced/secure-barcodes). |
| **NFC** | Pairs NFC tags to tickets for tap-based entry. See [NFC pairing](/core-platform/advanced/nfc-pairing). |

<Note>
The scanning mode affects the mobile app only. Admin-based admission and box office admission are not affected by this setting.
</Note>

## Zones

Zones represent distinct areas within your event where attendees are scanned in or out. Every event has at least one zone — the default **Entry** zone — and additional zones can be created for separate areas such as VIP sections, stages, or product collection points.

Zones are managed from the **Zones** tab on the event dashboard.

### Zone Configuration

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | The zone name, displayed in the scanning app and reports. |
| **Scanning mode** | Controls how scans are recorded for this zone (see below). |
| **Scanning limit** | Controls whether attendees can re-enter the zone (see below). |
| **Scanning accuracy** | **Precision scanning** shows a confirmation screen when a scan matches multiple eligible items (e.g. a ticket with add-ons). **Rapid scanning** selects the first eligible item automatically for faster throughput. |
| **Capacity** | Maximum number of attendees allowed in the zone at any time. Leave blank for unlimited. Only tracked when using an in/out scanning mode. |
| **Opening date** | Optionally restrict scanning to after a specific date and time. |
| **Closing date** | Optionally restrict scanning to before a specific date and time. |

### Scanning Modes (Zone-Level)

Each zone has its own scanning mode that controls how entry and exit are tracked.

| Mode | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| **In Only** | Attendees are scanned in. No exit scanning. Suitable for general entry gates where you only need to know who has arrived. |
| **In/Out Manual** | The operator selects whether they are scanning an attendee in or out. Tracks current occupancy and visit duration. |
| **In/Out Automatic** | The system automatically determines whether to scan in or out based on the attendee's current status. Tracks current occupancy and visit duration. |

<Note>
When using In/Out Automatic mode, rapid scanning is enabled automatically to avoid confusion during the automatic in/out decision.
</Note>

### Scanning Limit

| Option | Behaviour |
|--------|-----------|
| **Unlimited access** | Attendees can enter the zone as many times as they like. |
| **Single access** | Each ticket can only be scanned in once. Subsequent entry attempts are rejected. |

### Eligible Items

By default, all barcoded items (tickets, products, etc.) for the event can be used to access every zone. You can restrict a zone to specific sale items by disabling **Allow all tickets** and selecting the items that should be permitted.

### Age Restrictions

Zones can optionally enforce minimum and/or maximum age limits. This requires the date of birth [data capture](/core-platform/data-capture/introduction) field to be enabled. When an attendee's date of birth is not available, it is at the operator's discretion whether to admit them.

### Auto Scan-Out

For zones using an in/out scanning mode, you can configure **auto scan-out times** — scheduled times at which all attendees currently in the zone are automatically scanned out. This is useful for clearing a zone at the end of a session, shift, or event day.

Entering a past time will immediately scan out all current attendees.

### Advanced Zone Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Ignore validity dates** | When enabled, the zone does not check the sale item's validity dates when admitting attendees. Useful for zones that should accept any valid ticket regardless of time restrictions. |
| **Hide attendees** | Hides the attendee list from the zone view in the [Access Control Pro](/mobile-apps/access-control-pro) app. |

## Validity Dates

Validity dates control the time window during which a ticket is valid for entry. They are configured per [sale item](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts) and determine when the [Access Control Pro](/mobile-apps/access-control-pro) app will accept a scan.

See [validity dates](/core-platform/access-control/validity-dates) for full details.

### Check-in Time Options

When configuring a sale item's scanning settings, you can choose how the validity window is determined:

| Option | Behaviour |
|--------|-----------|
| **Anytime** | The ticket can be scanned at any time — no time-based restrictions apply. |
| **Hour before event** | Valid from one hour before the event start time until the event end time. |
| **Custom** | Set specific valid-from and valid-until dates and times. |
| **Timeslot-based** | Valid during the [timeslot](/core-platform/event-management/timeslots) the ticket belongs to (only available for timeslotted items). |

### Scanning Grace Period

A grace period (in minutes) can be set on each sale item to extend the validity window in both directions. For example, a 15-minute grace period allows scanning 15 minutes before the valid-from time and 15 minutes after the valid-until time.

<Note>
The grace period only applies when scanning into zones that have validity date checks enabled (i.e. where **Ignore validity dates** is not turned on).
</Note>

### Displaying Validity in the Shop

You can optionally display check-in times to customers in their account, order confirmation, and on ticket media by enabling **Show check-in times in shop** on the sale item.

## Zone Statistics

The zones listing on the event dashboard displays real-time statistics for each zone:

- **Attendance** — Number of unique attendees scanned in (and current occupancy for in/out zones).
- **Capacity** — Current occupancy relative to the zone's capacity limit.
- **Scan mode** — The zone's scanning mode (in only, in/out).
- **Scan limit** — Whether access is unlimited or single-entry.
- **Age restrictions** — Minimum and/or maximum age, if configured.

### Reports

Three reports are available from the zones listing:

- **Scanning Report** — Detailed log of all scans across zones.
- **Zone Summary Report** — Aggregated statistics per zone.
- **Customer Journey Report** — Tracks each attendee's movement across zones.

## Data Capture

Custom [data capture](/core-platform/data-capture/introduction) fields can be configured for access control. When enabled, these fields are presented to operators in the scanning app, allowing information to be collected at the point of admission.
