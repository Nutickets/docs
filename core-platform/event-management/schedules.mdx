## Overview

A schedule is a group of related events. Schedules enable:

- Grouping events for display on a dedicated schedule listing page
- Allowing customers to browse dates via a calendar interface
- Selling [season tickets](/core-platform/season-tickets/overview) that grant access to all events in the schedule

Schedules can be created in two ways:

1. **Linking standalone events** — Attach multiple separate events together into a schedule
2. **Creating repeating events** — Turn a single event into a repeating series

These approaches can be combined: standalone events can be attached to existing repeating series and vice versa.

### Removing Events from a Schedule

Individual events can be removed from a schedule (unscheduled), reverting them to standalone events. If a schedule is reduced to fewer than two events, the schedule is automatically deleted.

## Schedule Types

Every schedule has a type that determines how events are displayed to customers:

| Type                 | Description                                                                                                                                    | Use Case                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Mixed events**     | Events are related but unique. A dedicated schedule listing page displays all events, allowing customers to navigate between dates.            | Theatre productions with different shows, festival days with different lineups |
| **Repeating events** | Events are identical. A schedule calendar appears in the ticket selection modal, letting customers browse available dates from any event page. | Weekly classes, recurring tours, regular performances                          |

<Note>
  Mixed event schedules always have a listing page. Repeating event schedules
  can optionally enable a listing page.
</Note>

## Schedule Listing Page

The schedule listing page is a customer-facing page that displays all events in the schedule.

## Rebooking Settings (Legacy)

<Warning>
  This is a legacy feature. For flexible order modifications that aren't
  restricted to schedules, see [Order
  Modifications](/core-platform/order-management/order-modifications).
</Warning>

Schedules can enable rebooking, allowing customers or staff to move orders to different dates within the same schedule.

| Setting                       | Description                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Allow staff rebooking**     | Admins can move existing orders to a new date within this schedule via box office                                         |
| **Staff rebooking cutoff**    | Number of days before an event starts when staff can no longer rebook. Set to 0 to allow rebooking right up to the event. |
| **Allow customer rebooking**  | Customers can move their orders to a new date via their My Account section                                                |
| **Customer rebooking cutoff** | Number of days before an event starts when customers can no longer rebook                                                 |

## Season Ticket Label

For schedules that offer [season tickets](/core-platform/season-tickets/overview), you can customise the badge text displayed during checkout. By default, this shows "Season ticket".

## Schedule Groups

Schedule groups (also called sub-schedules) allow you to organise and subdivide larger schedules. This is useful when you want to apply bulk changes to a subset of events rather than the entire schedule.

- Each group has a name for identification
- An event can belong to only one group at a time, but can be moved between groups freely
- By default, events are "ungrouped" and reside at the root of the schedule
- When bulk editing events in a schedule, you can choose to apply changes to:
  - All events in the schedule
  - Only events in a specific sub-group
  - Only ungrouped events

<Note>
  Schedule groups are managed from the schedule dashboard. Navigate to an event
  in the schedule, then access the schedule dashboard to create, edit, or delete
  groups.
</Note>

## Creating Repeating Events

When creating repeating events from an existing event, you can configure:

### Repeat Cycle

| Cycle        | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Daily**    | Repeat every _n_ days (e.g., every day, every 2 days)                                                                        |
| **Weekly**   | Select specific days of the week (e.g., every Tuesday and Thursday)                                                          |
| **Monthly**  | Select specific dates of the month (e.g., the 1st and 15th). Only dates 1-28 are available to ensure validity in all months. |
| **Annually** | Once per year on the selected date                                                                                           |
| **Custom**   | Hand-pick specific dates from a calendar                                                                                     |

### Repeat Window

- **Repeat start window**: The date from which repeats should begin
- **Repeat end window**: Either:
  - An end date (repeats stop on or before this date), or
  - A number of occurrences (e.g., repeat for 30 events)

<Warning>
  A maximum of 31 events can be created in a single repeat action. For larger
  schedules, add repeats in batches.
</Warning>

### What Gets Copied

When creating repeating events, you can select which elements to copy from the original event:

- **Sale items** (tickets, add-ons) — Copied items retain a reference to the original, allowing bulk editing and rebooking across the schedule
- **Seating plan** — The seating configuration is replicated
- **Sale periods** — Custom on-sale windows are copied
- **Zones** — Access control zones are replicated
- **Sale item groups** — Groupings are preserved
- **Timeslots** — Time divisions within the event
- **Data capture questions** — Customer questions are copied
- **Internal questions** — Staff-facing questions and responses

### Publishing

You can choose to:

- **Publish immediately** — Events go live as they are created
- **Publish manually** — Events are created as drafts, allowing you to publish them individually
