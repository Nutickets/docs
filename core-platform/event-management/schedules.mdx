## Overview

A schedule is a group of related events. Schedules enable:

- Grouping events for display on a dedicated schedule listing page
- Allowing customers to browse dates via a calendar interface
- Selling [season tickets](/core-platform/season-tickets/overview) that grant access to all events in the schedule

Schedules can be created in two ways:

1. **Linking standalone events** — Attach multiple separate events together into a schedule
2. **Creating repeating events** — Turn a single event into a repeating series

These approaches can be combined: standalone events can be attached to existing repeating series and vice versa.

### Removing Events from a Schedule

Individual events can be removed from a schedule (unscheduled), reverting them to standalone events. If a schedule is reduced to fewer than two events, the schedule is automatically deleted.

## Schedule Types

Every schedule has a type that determines how events are displayed to customers:

| Type                 | Description                                                                                                                                    | Use Case                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Mixed events**     | Events are related but unique. A dedicated schedule listing page displays all events, allowing customers to navigate between dates.            | Theatre productions with different shows, festival days with different lineups |
| **Repeating events** | Events are identical. A schedule calendar appears in the ticket selection modal, letting customers browse available dates from any event page. | Weekly classes, recurring tours, regular performances                          |

<Note>
  Mixed event schedules always have a listing page. Repeating event schedules
  can optionally enable a listing page.
</Note>

## Schedule Listing Page

The schedule listing page is a customer-facing page that displays all events in the schedule.

## Rebooking Settings (Legacy)

<Warning>
  This is a legacy feature. For flexible order modifications that aren't
  restricted to schedules, see [Order
  Modifications](/core-platform/order-management/order-modifications).
</Warning>

Schedules can enable rebooking, allowing customers or staff to move orders to different dates within the same schedule.

| Setting                       | Description                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Allow staff rebooking**     | Admins can move existing orders to a new date within this schedule via box office                                         |
| **Staff rebooking cutoff**    | Number of days before an event starts when staff can no longer rebook. Set to 0 to allow rebooking right up to the event. |
| **Allow customer rebooking**  | Customers can move their orders to a new date via their My Account section                                                |
| **Customer rebooking cutoff** | Number of days before an event starts when customers can no longer rebook                                                 |

## Season Ticket Label

For schedules that offer [season tickets](/core-platform/season-tickets/overview), you can customise the badge text displayed during checkout. By default, this shows "Season ticket".

## Schedule Groups

Schedule groups (also called sub-schedules) allow you to organise and subdivide larger schedules into logical sections. Each group appears as a tab on the schedule dashboard, making it easy to manage subsets of events independently.

This is particularly useful for schedules with many events where certain events share characteristics — for example, grouping weekend performances separately from weekday ones, or organising a festival schedule by stage or genre.

### How Groups Work

- Each group has a **name** that appears as a tab on the schedule dashboard
- An event can belong to **only one group** at a time, but can be moved between groups freely
- Events not assigned to any group appear under the **Ungrouped** tab, which is always the first tab
- Group names support [translations](/core-platform/core/translations), so they can be localised for multi-language shops

### Creating a Schedule Group

1. Navigate to any event in the schedule and open the **schedule dashboard**
2. Select **Create sub schedule tab** from the tab actions
3. Enter a **name** for the group
4. Select the **events** you want to include — only upcoming events from the current schedule that are not already in another group are available
5. Save the group

The new group appears as a tab on the schedule dashboard immediately.

### Editing a Schedule Group

1. On the schedule dashboard, navigate to the tab for the group you want to edit
2. Select **Edit sub schedule tab** from the tab actions
3. Update the group **name** or change which **events** belong to the group
4. Save your changes

<Note>
  When you deselect events during editing, they return to the **Ungrouped** tab — they are not deleted.
</Note>

### Deleting a Schedule Group

1. On the schedule dashboard, navigate to the tab for the group you want to remove
2. Select the delete action and confirm
3. All events in the group return to the **Ungrouped** tab

### Bulk Editing with Groups

When [bulk editing](/core-platform/utilities/bulk-editing) events in a schedule, you can scope changes to:

- **All events** in the schedule
- Only events in a **specific sub-group**
- Only **ungrouped** events

This lets you make targeted changes — for example, adjusting ticket prices for all weekend events without affecting weekday events.

## Creating Repeating Events

When creating repeating events from an existing event, you can configure:

### Repeat Cycle

| Cycle        | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Daily**    | Repeat every _n_ days (e.g., every day, every 2 days)                                                                        |
| **Weekly**   | Select specific days of the week (e.g., every Tuesday and Thursday)                                                          |
| **Monthly**  | Select specific dates of the month (e.g., the 1st and 15th). Only dates 1-28 are available to ensure validity in all months. |
| **Annually** | Once per year on the selected date                                                                                           |
| **Custom**   | Hand-pick specific dates from a calendar                                                                                     |

### Repeat Window

- **Repeat start window**: The date from which repeats should begin
- **Repeat end window**: Either:
  - An end date (repeats stop on or before this date), or
  - A number of occurrences (e.g., repeat for 30 events)

<Warning>
  A maximum of 31 events can be created in a single repeat action. For larger
  schedules, add repeats in batches.
</Warning>

### What Gets Copied

When creating repeating events, you can select which elements to copy from the original event:

- **Sale items** (tickets, add-ons) — Copied items retain a reference to the original, allowing bulk editing and rebooking across the schedule
- **Seating plan** — The seating configuration is replicated
- **Sale periods** — Custom on-sale windows are copied
- **Zones** — Access control zones are replicated
- **Sale item groups** — Groupings are preserved
- **Timeslots** — Time divisions within the event
- **Data capture questions** — Customer questions are copied
- **Internal questions** — Staff-facing questions and responses

### Publishing

You can choose to:

- **Publish immediately** — Events go live as they are created
- **Publish manually** — Events are created as drafts, allowing you to publish them individually
