## Overview

- A seating plan can be attached to an event to make it a reserved seating event.
- Event seating is configured in two parts:
  1. Attach and sync a plan to the event.
  2. Configure event-level seating behavior (for example, best seats, manual seat selection, and seat status controls).
- Event seating data is synced from the source plan into event-specific records, so you can manage statuses, holds, and price band assignments per event.

## Before You Start

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Seating plans feature | Your company must have seating plans enabled. |
| Permissions | You need event edit permissions (edit or edit relationships) to attach/change/configure event seating. |
| Venue match | You can only select complete seating plans from the same venue as the event. |
| Plan completeness | Incomplete seating plans cannot be assigned to events. |

<Warning>
If an event already has sales and no seating plan attached yet, you cannot attach one.
</Warning>

## Attach A Seating Plan

1. Open the event dashboard.
2. In suggested actions, click **Add a seating plan**.
3. Select an available plan for that event's venue, or create a new plan.
4. Submit to queue the sync.

If the event is part of a schedule, you can apply the same plan assignment to related events in the same schedule flow.

## What Sync Does

- Sync runs in the background and can take time on larger plans.
- Event-level seating entities are imported from the plan schema, including event price bands and spaces.
- If the event has timeslots, spaces are synced for the event-level pass and timeslot-level inventory.
- While syncing, the plan dashboard is not available; you are redirected to plan settings/progress.
- You can cancel an in-progress import from the settings page.

## Configure Event Seating Settings

In **Plan settings**, you can configure:

| Setting | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Focus shop view on available seats** | Zooms customers into saleable areas and crops unavailable areas while navigating the plan in shop. |
| **Allow customer seat selection** | Enables/disables manual seat picking in shop. |
| **Enable best available seats** | Enables best-seat suggestions based on score/price band logic. Requires a focal point on the plan. |
| **Best available seats adjacency mode** | `Any`, `Prefer adjacency`, or `Only adjacent`. |
| **Enable orphan seat protection** | Attempts to reduce stranded single seats in best-seat/manual flows. Not available with adjacency mode `Any`. |
| **Display remaining general admission spaces in shop** | Shows remaining quantity for general admission areas. |
| **Enable automatic ticket selection** | Auto-selects a ticket when multiple tickets map to a seat; free tickets are ignored by this selector. |
| **Automatic ticket selection mode** | Choose **Lowest price** or **Highest price** ticket selection. |

<Note>
Best available seat controls only appear when the best-available feature is enabled for the company. A focal point must exist on the seating plan to enable best seats.
</Note>

## Assign Tickets To Price Bands

- Tickets and season tickets are mapped to event price bands in plan settings.
- Seats/areas in price bands without mapped sale items are not saleable.
- The seating dashboard view requires at least one sale item assigned to a price band.

## Ongoing Plan Changes

After a plan is attached, use **Resync plan** to choose:

- **Apply revisions**: Apply new seating plan revisions made since the last completed sync.
- **Factory reset seating plan**: Rebuild from the source plan state. The UI warns this overrides event-specific changes such as seat statuses, price bands, and holds.

If the event has no sales, UI actions allow choosing a different seating plan. If the event is in a schedule, changes can be mass-applied to related events.

## Plan Dashboard

Once synced and configured, the event plan dashboard supports:

- Viewing by event pass or timeslot.
- Full-plan and area-focused navigation.
- Updating seat statuses (`Available`, `Unavailable`, `Hidden`, `Restricted`).
- Restricting seats to roles/holds and creating new holds inline.
- Repricing selected spaces to different price bands.
- Reallocating sold/reserved seats.
- Exporting plan images with export options.
