title: 'Timeslots'
description: 'Split events into specific admission windows with independent stock, on-sale rules, and visibility controls.'
---

## Overview

- Timeslots divide an event into distinct admission windows, each with its own date/time range, stock, on-sale period, and visibility settings.
- Timeslots are managed from the event dashboard under **Manage time slots**.
- Timeslot names support [translations](/core-platform/core/translations), allowing localised labels per language. When no name is set, the configured time display format is used instead.
- For seated events, creating a timeslot automatically creates the corresponding [seating plan](/core-platform/event-management/seated-events) spaces for that slot.
- All timeslot dates respect the event's [timezone](/core-platform/core/timezones) and must fall within the event's start and end dates.

<Note>
  Timeslots require the timeslots feature to be enabled for your company. Users
  need timeslot permissions (create, edit, delete) along with event edit and
  edit-relationship access.
</Note>

## Use Cases

<Accordion title="Timed entry for attractions">
  A theme park or visitor attraction manages crowd flow by offering timed entry
  slots — for example, every 30 minutes from 9am to 5pm. Each slot has its own
  capacity, and the repeat interval generates all slots automatically. **Hide
  when sold out** keeps the page clean as slots fill up.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Multi-day festival with day passes">
  A three-day festival uses daily timeslots so customers purchase entry for
  specific days. Each day has its own stock, allowing capacity to be managed
  independently per day.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Guided tours with scheduled departures">
  Walking tours depart every hour with a fixed group size of 15. Hourly
  repeating timeslots enforce the group limit per departure. Customers can
  filter by time of day to find a convenient tour.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Workshops and classes with limited places">
  A venue runs pottery classes at 10am, 2pm, and 6pm. Each session has a limited
  number of places. Different ticket types (adult, child) can be created within
  each timeslot, and the timeslot stock ensures total attendance per session
  stays within the instructor's capacity.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Exhibition with optional timed viewing">
  An exhibition offers timed viewing slots for peak hours but also sells general
  admission tickets for the full day. Timeslotted tickets manage peak-hour
  capacity, while non-timeslotted tickets appear under the **Whole Event**
  option for visitors who prefer flexible entry.
</Accordion>

## Creating Timeslots

Use **Create a time slot series** from the timeslot management page to generate one or more timeslots.

### Core Fields

| Field                         | Description                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**                      | Optional. Supports multiple languages. When omitted, the display falls back to the configured time format. |
| **Validity dates**            | Required start and end date/time. Must fall within the event's start and end dates.                        |
| **Repeat**                    | One-off, or repeating at an interval: minutes, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or annually.                |
| **Repeats every**             | Interval between repeats (`1`–`60`). Only shown when a repeat option is selected.                          |
| **Generate time slots until** | End boundary for generation. Defaults to the event end date/time.                                          |

### Advanced Options

| Field                      | Description                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Time slot stock**        | `Unlimited` (no cap) or `Limited to` a specific number. See [Stock Rules](#stock-rules).                                                                |
| **Sale items**             | Selecting items creates new [sale item](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts) instances in each generated timeslot. Existing items are not modified. |
| **On sale dates**          | Optional start and end dates controlling when the timeslot is available for purchase.                                                                   |
| **Hide when off-sale**     | Hides the timeslot when outside its on-sale period or after it has ended.                                                                               |
| **Hide when out-of-stock** | Hides the timeslot when stock is exhausted.                                                                                                             |

### Scheduled Events

For events that belong to a [schedule](/core-platform/event-management/schedules), the creation form offers the option to create equivalent timeslots on other upcoming events in the same schedule. Timeslot dates and on-sale dates are adjusted relative to each target event's dates.

### Limits

Each event has a maximum number of timeslots, controlled by a company setting (default: `30`). The creation form displays the remaining capacity and blocks submission if the generated timeslots would exceed it.

<Warning>
  Timeslots cannot be created if the event already has [season
  tickets](/core-platform/season-tickets/overview). The two features are
  mutually exclusive.
</Warning>

## Managing Timeslots

### Admin View

The timeslot management page displays timeslots in a calendar view with weekly and daily pagination. Each timeslot shows:

- Name and display time
- Capacity bar (sold, reserved, remaining)
- Sale status (on sale, off sale, sold out)
- Quick actions: add tickets, toggle sale status, delete

Timeslots can be reordered via drag-and-drop. The sort order determines the display sequence in the shop.

### Editing a Single Timeslot

Open a timeslot from the calendar view to edit its name, dates, stock mode/quantity, on-sale dates, visibility toggles, and assigned sale items.

<Note>
  If your role only allows stock edits after publish, timeslot fields become
  read-only while stock remains editable.
</Note>

### Toggling Sale Status

The timeslot list provides a quick toggle to take a timeslot on or off sale without opening the full edit form.

### Bulk Updating

From the edit view, use **Edit time slots** to apply changes across multiple timeslots.

**Scope** — which timeslots to target:

- **Just this time slot**
- **Time slots within this event**
- **Time slots within this schedule** (if the event belongs to a schedule)

**Filters** — narrow the target set:

| Filter         | Options                                                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**      | All time slots, Future time slots, Past time slots                                    |
| **Time**       | All time slots, All time slots matching minutes past, Time slots with this exact time |
| **Comparison** | All time slots, Time slots before, Time slots after                                   |

When more than `100` matches are found, individual rows are not listed but criteria-based updating is still supported.

On-sale dates in bulk updates are adjusted relative to each target timeslot's existing on-sale dates. If the source or target timeslot does not have on-sale dates, the specified date is applied directly.

### Overwriting from the Event Dashboard

Timeslots can also be edited in bulk from the event dashboard. Select one or more timeslots from the list and click **Edit** to open the overwrite modal. This presents a blank form — only the fields you modify are applied to the selected timeslots.

### Deleting Timeslots

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="No Orders or Reservations">
    The timeslot and its assigned sale items are deleted.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Existing Orders or Reservations">
    The timeslot is kept but its sale items are taken off sale. A warning is
    shown in the admin.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Deleted timeslots are soft-deleted and can be restored.

## Shop and Box Office Behaviour

### Visibility and Sale State

A timeslot is purchasable when all of the following are true:

1. The event is on sale.
2. The timeslot is within its on-sale period.
3. The timeslot has not ended.
4. There are visible sale items with available stock for the timeslot.

Timeslots that are sold out or off sale appear greyed-out with a **Sold Out** or **Off Sale** badge.

### Hide Rules

- **Hide when off-sale** — removes the timeslot from view when it is outside its sale period or after its end time.
- **Hide when out-of-stock** — removes the timeslot from view when stock is exhausted.

### Customer Filters

The shop provides a time filter allowing customers to narrow timeslots by time of day (e.g. morning, afternoon, or a specific time).

### Display Format

The event setting **Display timeslot** controls how timeslot times are rendered to customers:

| Option                        | Behaviour                         |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Display start & end times     | Shows both the start and end time |
| Display start, hide end times | Shows the start time only         |
| Display end, hide start times | Shows the end time only           |
| Hide start & end times        | No time is displayed              |

Each timeslot also shows its lowest price when visible in the shop.

### Whole Event Option

If an event has both timeslotted and non-timeslotted sale items, the shop displays a **Whole Event** pseudo-slot alongside the actual timeslots. This allows customers to purchase items that are not assigned to a specific timeslot.

### Box Office

[Box office](/core-platform/box-office/introduction) users can view and interact with timeslots that are hidden or off-sale on the public shop, allowing sales outside the normal visibility rules.

## Stock Rules

- **Unlimited** — no timeslot-level sales cap is applied.
- **Limited** — a specific sales cap for the timeslot. Total stock cannot be set below the sum of already sold and reserved quantities; current stock is recalculated as total minus sold and reserved.
- Effective saleability is the **minimum** of the timeslot's own stock and the stock of its assigned sale items. Both must have availability for a purchase to succeed.

## Related Constraints

- Timeslotted sale items cannot be associated with [sale item groups](/core-platform/event-management/sale-item-groups).
- Tickets assigned to a timeslot use the timeslot's start and end dates as their [validity window](/core-platform/event-management/access-control#validity-dates).
- If event dates are changed after creating timeslots, the admin flags out-of-bounds timeslots so they can be corrected.
