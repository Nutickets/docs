## Overview

- Time slots split an event into specific admission windows, while still staying inside the event's start/end dates.
- Time slots are managed from the event dashboard in **Manage time slots**.
- Each time slot has its own date/time range, optional on-sale dates, optional stock limit, and visibility controls.
- Time slots can be updated individually or in bulk across an event or schedule.
- For seated events, creating a time slot also creates the corresponding seating-plan spaces for that slot.

## Access Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Feature availability | Time slots must be enabled for your company. |
| Permissions | Users need time slot permissions plus event edit/edit-relationship access. |
| Event state | Time slot date/time values must stay within the event date range. |
| Season tickets | New time slots cannot be created if the event already has season tickets. |

<Note>
If your role only allows stock edits after publish, time slot fields can become read-only while stock remains editable.
</Note>

## Time Slot Limits

- Standard setup allows up to `30` time slots in a single creation attempt.
- Your company settings may use a different limit.
- The create flow shows the current allowance and blocks submission if the generated slots exceed the allowed amount for that attempt.

## Creating Time Slots

Use **Create a time slot series** from the time slot dashboard.

### Core Fields

| Field | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Optional. If omitted, display falls back to the configured time display format. |
| **Validity dates** | Required start and end date/time for each slot. Slots must sit within the event start and end date/time. |
| **Repeat options** | Supports one-off or repeated generation (minutes, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly). |
| **Repeats every** | Numeric interval (`1` to `60`). |
| **Generate time slots until** | End boundary for generation (defaults to event end date/time). |

### Advanced Options

| Field | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Time slot stock** | `Unlimited` or `Limited to X`. |
| **Scheduled events** | For scheduled events, you can create equivalent slots on other upcoming events in the same schedule. |
| **Sale items** | Selecting items creates new sale-item instances in each generated time slot (existing items are not modified). |
| **On sale dates** | Optional start and end dates for when the slot is available to buy. |
| **Hide when off-sale** | Hides the slot when outside its sale period or after it has ended. |
| **Hide when out-of-stock** | Hides the slot when stock is exhausted. |

<Note>
When applying creation to scheduled events, time slot and on-sale dates are adjusted relative to each target event's dates.
</Note>

## Editing and Bulk Updating

### Single Time Slot Edit

- Edit a slot from the calendar/list view.
- You can update name, dates, stock mode/quantity, on-sale dates, visibility toggles, and assigned sale items.

### Bulk Update

From edit, use **Edit time slots** to apply selected changes to:

- **Just this time slot**
- **Time slots within this event**
- **Time slots within this schedule** (if the event belongs to a schedule)

Filter bulk targets by:

- **Scope**: all, future, past
- **Time**: all, matching minutes past, exact matching time
- **Comparison**: all, before source time, after source time

If more than `100` matches are found, individual rows are not listed, but criteria-based update is still supported.

## Shop and Box Office Behavior

### Visibility and Sale State

A slot is treated as purchasable when:

- the event is on sale,
- the slot is in its sale period,
- the slot is not in the past,
- and there are visible sale items with availability for that slot.

### Hide Rules

- `Hide when off-sale` removes visibility when the slot is not in-sale (and after slot end).
- `Hide when out-of-stock` removes visibility when stock is exhausted.
- Box office can still access slots even when they would be hidden on the public shop.

### Display Format

The event setting **Display timeslot** controls how slot times are rendered to customers:

- Show both start and end
- Show start only
- Show end only
- Hide timeslot time display

### Whole-Event Option

If an event also has non-timeslotted tickets, the shop can show an additional pseudo-slot (`Whole Event`) alongside actual time slots.

## Stock Rules

- Unlimited slot stock means no time-slot sales limit is applied.
- Limited slot stock applies a specific sales limit to the slot.
- When changing to limited stock, total stock cannot be set below already sold + reserved quantity.
- Current stock is recalculated from total stock minus sold and reserved quantities.
- Effective saleability can be constrained by both slot stock and assigned sale-item stock.

## Deleting Time Slots

### No Orders/Reservations

- The slot can be deleted.
- Assigned sale items for that slot are deleted with it.

### Existing Orders/Reservations

- The slot is not deleted.
- Slot sale items are taken off sale instead.
- A warning is shown in Admin.

## Related Constraints

- Time-slotted sale items cannot be associated with sale item groups.
- Tickets assigned to a time slot use the slot dates as their validity window.
- If event dates are changed after creating slots, Admin flags out-of-bounds slots so they can be corrected.
