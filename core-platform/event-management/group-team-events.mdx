description: 'How to enable team or group entries for events, allowing customers to create, join, and manage teams during checkout.'
---

## Overview

- Team events allow customers to participate as part of a named team or group rather than as individuals.
- The terminology is configurable per event — you can use **Team** or **Group** throughout the customer-facing shop. This page uses "team" as the default term, but all behaviour applies equally to "group" when that terminology is selected.
- During checkout, customers choose to **create a new team**, **join an existing team** via a code, or **enter solo** (if permitted).
- The first customer to create a team becomes the **team leader**. Subsequent customers who join become **members**.
- Team size can be constrained with minimum and maximum limits, enforced during checkout.
- The **Event Teams** feature must be enabled for your company.

<Note>
  Teams cannot be enabled for events that have [season
  tickets](/core-platform/sale-items/season-tickets). Enabling teams on such an
  event is blocked with a validation error.
</Note>

## Configuration

Team settings are configured on the event dashboard under **Team Settings** (or **Group Settings**, depending on the selected terminology).

### Terminology

| Option     | Description                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Teams**  | All customer-facing labels use "Team" terminology (e.g. "Create a new team", "Team Settings", "Team 1").     |
| **Groups** | All customer-facing labels use "Group" terminology (e.g. "Create a new group", "Group Settings", "Group 1"). |

The terminology choice only affects the wording displayed in the shop — it does not change any underlying behaviour.

### Naming

| Setting                  | Description                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Allow custom names**   | Customers can provide a name when creating a team. When disabled, names are automatically generated (e.g. "Team 1", "Team 2").          |
| **Names must be unique** | Enforces that every team name within the event is unique. If a customer enters a name already in use, they are asked to choose another. |
| **Names can be edited**  | Allows the team leader to edit the team name after creation from their account. Only the team leader has this permission.               |

### Joining & Solo Entry

| Setting                            | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Allow join via code**            | Customers can join an existing team by entering the team's unique code during checkout. The code is generated automatically when a team is created.          |
| **Can people enter individually?** | When enabled, customers can choose solo participation — they are not required to create or join a team. When disabled, every customer must belong to a team. |

### Size Constraints

| Setting                    | Description                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enforce a minimum size** | Teams must have at least the specified number of members before the order can be completed. Validated at order completion. |
| **Enforce a maximum size** | Teams cannot exceed the specified number of members. Validated when items are added to the basket.                         |

<Note>
  [Box office](/core-platform/box-office/introduction) users with the
  appropriate permission can bypass minimum and maximum team size validation.
</Note>

## Customer Flow

When a customer adds items for a team-enabled event, a **Team Settings** step appears during checkout. The options presented depend on the event's configuration.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Create a Team">
    The customer creates a new team. If custom names are enabled, they can enter a name — otherwise, a name is automatically generated (e.g. "Team 1").

    The customer becomes the **team leader** for the new team. A unique team code is generated, which can be shared with others to join.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Join a Team">
    Available when **Allow join via code** is enabled. The customer enters the code of an existing team to join it.

    The customer becomes a **team member**. If the team has a maximum size limit and is already full, the join attempt is blocked with an error.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Solo Entry">
    Available when **Can people enter individually?** is enabled. The customer participates without creating or joining a team.

    No team is assigned to the order items.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

If the customer already has a team for this event (from a previous purchase), they are informed that additional tickets will be added to their existing team rather than being prompted to choose again.

### Validation During Checkout

| Scenario | When checked | Error |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Team is full (maximum size reached) | When adding items to basket | "The team size has been exceeded" |
| Team is below minimum size | When completing the order | "The team size has not been met" |
| Team name already exists (uniqueness enabled) | When creating or renaming a team | "The team name must be unique" |
| Invalid team code | When joining a team | "The team code is invalid" |

## Team Roles

Each team member has one of two roles:

| Role       | Description                                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Leader** | The customer who created the team. Can edit the team name (if enabled) and promote other members to leader. Only one leader per team. |
| **Member** | Customers who joined the team. Cannot edit the team name. Can be promoted to leader by the current leader.                            |

When a member is promoted to leader, the previous leader is automatically demoted to a member.

## Team Management

Customers can view and manage their teams from **My Account** under the **Teams** (or **Groups**) section.

### Team Details

The team details page displays:

- The team name and number
- The associated event
- The team code (copyable, for sharing with others to join)
- The member list with names, emails, and roles
- [Data capture](/core-platform/data-capture/introduction) responses (if configured for the event)

### Available Actions

| Action                | Who         | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Edit team name**    | Leader      | Change the team name. Only available if **Names can be edited** is enabled. Names are validated against the same rules as during creation (uniqueness, character restrictions). |
| **Promote to leader** | Leader      | Promote a member to team leader. The current leader becomes a member.                                                                                                           |
| **Copy team code**    | All members | Copy the team code to share with others. Only useful when **Allow join via code** is enabled.                                                                                   |
| **Email all members** | All members | Opens a mailto link addressed to all team members.                                                                                                                              |

## Email Notifications

Order confirmation emails include team details when the order is associated with a team:

- If the customer **created** the team: the email thanks them for creating the team and includes the team name.
- If the customer **joined** the team: the email thanks them for joining and includes the team name.
- If **Allow join via code** is enabled: the email includes the team code so it can be shared with others.

All email content respects the configured terminology (team or group).

## Schedule Support

Team settings can be configured on individual events within a [schedule](/core-platform/event-management/schedules). When updating team settings, you can apply the changes to the current event only or mass-update all events in the schedule.

## Reporting

Team data is available in [order reports](/core-platform/reporting/fundamentals) with the following fields:

| Field         | Description                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Team ID**   | The unique identifier of the team.    |
| **Team name** | The team's display name.              |
| **Team role** | The member's role (Leader or Member). |

## Differences from Standard Events

Team-enabled events behave the same as standard events in most respects — they support [sale items](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts), [timeslots](/core-platform/event-management/timeslots), [capacity controls](/core-platform/event-management/capacity-controls), [seating plans](/core-platform/event-management/seated-events), and all other event features. The key differences are:

- A **Team Settings** step is added to the checkout flow.
- Order items are associated with a team and assigned a role (leader or member).
- Customers can manage their teams from their account after purchase.
- Team size limits are enforced in addition to standard capacity controls.
