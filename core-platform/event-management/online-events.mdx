## Overview

- Online events are virtual events with no physical location. Customers attend by watching an embedded live stream on a private streaming page.
- Hybrid events combine a physical [venue](/core-platform/event-management/venues) with an online stream, allowing both in-person and remote attendance.
- Streaming is powered by an external provider — **YouTube**, **Vimeo**, or any other iframe-compatible service.
- Stream access is controlled per [sale item](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts), so you can choose which item types grant streaming access.
- The **Event Streams** feature must be enabled for your company.

## Event Location Types

When [creating an event](/core-platform/event-management/introduction), you select one of three location types:

| Type | Venue | Streaming | Description |
|------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **In Venue** | Required | Disabled | A physical event at a specific venue. No streaming. |
| **Online** | Not required | Enabled | A virtual-only event with no physical location. |
| **Both** | Required | Enabled | A hybrid event with both in-person attendance and an online stream. |

The location type can be changed after creation from the event dashboard by editing the event location.

<Note>
Selecting **Online** or **Both** automatically enables the streaming configuration. Switching to **In Venue** disables it.
</Note>

## Stream Configuration

Stream settings are configured on the event dashboard under **Event Streaming Settings**.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Enable event live stream** | Master toggle to enable or disable the stream for this event. |
| **Stream provider** | The streaming platform: **YouTube**, **Vimeo**, or **Other**. |
| **Stream URL** | The URL of the live stream from your provider. The platform automatically generates the correct embed URL based on the selected provider. |
| **Stream body** | Optional content ([WYSIWYG](/core-platform/utilities/wysiwyg)) displayed on the private streaming page alongside the video. Supports translations. |
| **Display live chat** | Show the provider's live chat alongside the stream. Available for YouTube and Vimeo. |

### Providers

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="YouTube">
    Paste any standard YouTube URL (e.g. `youtube.com/watch?v=...`, `youtu.be/...`, or embed URLs). The platform extracts the video ID and generates the correct embed URL.

    When **Display live chat** is enabled, the YouTube live chat is embedded alongside the stream.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Vimeo">
    Paste the Vimeo video URL. The platform calls the Vimeo API to extract the video ID and generates the correct player embed URL.

    When **Display live chat** is enabled, the Vimeo live chat is embedded alongside the stream.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Other">
    For other providers, paste the iframe-compatible embed URL directly. The URL is used as-is.

    Live chat is not available for custom providers.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Stream Access

### Per Sale Item

Each sale item has a **Can access stream** toggle (visible when the event has streaming enabled). This controls whether purchasing that item grants the customer access to the streaming page.

- **Enabled** (default) — customers who purchase this item can access the stream.
- **Disabled** — customers who purchase this item cannot access the stream. Useful for items like merchandise or add-ons that should not grant viewing access.

### Customer Experience

Customers access the stream from their account by clicking **Access stream** on a purchased item that has stream access. The stream is accessed via a private URL tied to the customer's specific order item barcode.

The streaming page displays:
- The embedded video player from the configured provider.
- The stream body content (if configured).
- Live chat (if enabled and supported by the provider).
- A countdown timer if the event has not yet started.

**Stream availability**: The stream becomes viewable up to 60 seconds before the event's start time. Before that, customers see a countdown. After the event ends, the stream is no longer available.

### Single-Device Restriction

Each ticket can only access the stream on **one device at a time**. If a customer attempts to access the stream on a second device while already viewing on another, they are redirected back to their orders with a warning message.

<Note>
The order confirmation email for events with streaming includes a note informing customers that the stream can be accessed from the My Account section.
</Note>

## Differences from In-Venue Events

Online-only events behave the same as in-venue events in most respects — they support [sale items](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts), [timeslots](/core-platform/event-management/timeslots), [capacity controls](/core-platform/event-management/capacity-controls), [seating plans](/core-platform/event-management/seated-events), and all other event features. The key differences are:

- No venue is required or displayed.
- The event is labelled as an **Online event** in listings and on the event page.
- Customers access the event via the streaming page rather than a physical location.
