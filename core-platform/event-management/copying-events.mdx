## Overview

Copying an event creates one or more new events based on an existing event. This is useful for:
- Creating similar events on different dates
- Setting up recurring events without using [schedules](/core-platform/event-scheduling/core-concepts)
- Duplicating event configurations as a starting template

When copying, you choose which elements to include and whether to create standalone events or add them to a schedule.

## Accessing the Copy Feature

The copy event option is available from:
- The **Actions** dropdown menu on the event dashboard
- The **Advanced Actions** panel in the event sidebar
- The event header during setup

<Note>
You must have permission to create events to access this feature.
</Note>

## Copy Process

### Step 1: Select Dates

Choose the date(s) for your new event(s):

- **Start date and time**: When the new event begins
- **End date and time**: When the new event ends

You can add multiple dates to create several copies at once. The maximum number of dates you can add in a single operation is configured per company.

<Warning>
A maximum of 31 events can be created in a single copy operation.
</Warning>

### Step 2: Standalone or Scheduled

Choose how the copied event(s) should be created:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Standalone event** | Creates independent event(s) not linked to any schedule |
| **Scheduled event** | Adds the new event(s) to the same schedule as the source event |

This choice affects how sale items are handled — see [Item Handling](#item-handling) below.

### Step 3: Copy Settings

Select which elements to copy from the source event.

#### Always Copied

The following are always included when copying an event:

- Event data (name, dates, description)
- Event settings (timezone, locale, configuration)
- Event page details (content blocks and images)
- Tags
- Visibility groups
- Related event associations

#### Optional Elements

You can choose whether to include each of the following. Available options depend on what exists on the source event.

| Element | Options | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Seating plan** | Skip / Assign | Copies the seating plan, price bands, and seat allocations |
| **Sale periods** | Skip / Copy | Custom on-sale windows for the event |
| **Zones** | Skip / Copy | Access control zones. Opening/closing dates are cleared; auto scan-out times are not copied. |
| **Timeslots** | Skip / Copy | Time divisions within the event. You must separately select which sale items within each timeslot to copy. |
| **Sale item groups** | Skip / Copy | Groupings are preserved. You must separately select which items within each group to copy. |
| **Sale items** | See [Item Handling](#item-handling) | Tickets, add-ons, and other purchasable items |
| **Data capture questions** | Skip / Ask | Customer-facing questions attached to the event |
| **Internal questions** | Skip / Copy | Staff-facing questions and their current responses |

#### Publishing

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Draft** | New event(s) are created as drafts, not visible to customers |
| **Publish** | New event(s) go live immediately |

<Note>
You must have permission to publish events to use the Publish option. If copying a cancelled event, the new event is always created as a draft.
</Note>

When creating a standalone event as a draft, the event name is automatically prefixed with "Copy of".

## Item Handling

Sale items (tickets, add-ons, donations, etc.) can be handled in two ways:

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Resell existing** | The new event references the same inventory item. Stock is shared, and changes to the item affect all linked events. | Recurring events where you want unified inventory and bulk editing |
| **Copy (duplicate)** | Creates a new independent inventory item. Stock and settings are separate from the original. | One-off copies where events should be managed independently |

<Warning>
Duplicating an item disassociates it from the original. This prevents bulk editing, stock sharing, and rebooking within schedules.
</Warning>

### What's Copied with Items

When duplicating sale items:
- Sale prices and inventory settings are copied
- Add-on products are copied (maintaining parent-child relationships)
- Donation variants are copied
- Associated fees are reassigned
- Bundled items are re-bundled (if all items in the bundle are copied)

### Item Restrictions

- **Scheduled events**: You can choose to resell existing items or duplicate them
- **Standalone events**: You may need the "assign existing items" permission to resell existing items; otherwise items must be duplicated

## Date Adjustments

Time-based settings are automatically adjusted relative to the new event date:

- Timeslot start and end times
- Sale period on-sale and off-sale dates
- Sale item availability windows (on sale from/until, valid from/until)

The system calculates the offset between the source and target event dates and applies it to all time-based fields.

## After Copying

When a seating plan is copied, additional background processes run to:
- Sync seat availability statuses between the source and copied events
- Map price bands and reassign sale items to their corresponding bands

These processes run asynchronously and may take a few moments to complete for large seating plans.
