## Overview

Event media controls the visual design and layout of the documents your customers receive — whether that's a downloadable PDF ticket, a gift voucher, a cover sheet for postal delivery, or an Apple Wallet pass. Each of these is a **template** you can create and customise using the built-in template designer, then assign at multiple levels across your organisation.

Out of the box, the platform provides default templates for each media type. Event media lets you replace those defaults with branded designs that match your events, venue, or organisation.

## Media Types

The event media system supports four types of template, each serving a different purpose:

| Type | Purpose | Format |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Printable** | Ticket and product PDFs that customers download or you print at the box office | PDF |
| **Gift voucher** | Voucher PDFs with redemption codes, personalised messages, and branding | PDF |
| **Cover sheet** | Cover pages included with PDF downloads — typically for postal delivery with recipient addresses | PDF |
| **Apple Pass** | Mobile wallet passes that customers add to Apple Wallet on their iPhone | PKPass |

Printables, gift vouchers, and cover sheets are all PDF-based and share the same template designer. Apple Passes have their own configuration interface tailored to Apple's pass format.

<Note>
Event media requires the **Event Media** feature to be enabled for your account. Without it, the platform uses built-in default templates.
</Note>

## The Template Designer

All PDF-based templates (printables, gift vouchers, and cover sheets) are created and edited using the **template designer** — a visual editor where you build your layout by placing and arranging objects on a canvas.

The designer supports the following object types:

| Object | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Text** | Static labels or dynamic fields that pull in order, ticket, or event data |
| **QR code** | Scannable barcodes for ticket entry or gift voucher redemption |
| **Image** | Logos, backgrounds, or decorative graphics |
| **Shape** | Rectangles, circles, lines, and other geometric elements |

Text objects can include **dynamic fields** — placeholders like `order_reference` or `order_item_name` that are automatically replaced with real data when the PDF is generated. The designer provides a searchable field picker so you can browse all available placeholders, organised by category (order details, item details, seating, timeslots, purchaser, holder, event, labels, and data capture questions).

For detailed information on creating templates, paper sizes, and available fields, see [Custom PDFs](/core-platform/event-management/event-media/custom-pdfs).

## Assigning Templates

Templates can be assigned at multiple levels, creating a cascade where more specific assignments override broader defaults. The platform resolves which template to use for a given item by checking these levels in order:

| Level | Scope | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Sale item** | A specific sale item on a specific event | VIP tickets use a premium branded template |
| **Item type per event** | All items of a type on a specific event | All tickets on this event use a festival-branded template |
| **Event** | All items on a specific event | Everything on this event uses the same template |
| **Venue** | All events at a venue | All events at this venue share a venue-branded template |
| **Item type (company)** | All items of a type across your account | All season tickets company-wide use a specific template |
| **Company** | All items across your account | The organisation-wide default |
| **System default** | Built-in fallback | The platform's built-in template |

The platform checks from the top of this list downward and uses the first template it finds. This means you can set a company-wide default and then override it for specific venues, events, or individual sale items without affecting everything else.

### Configuring Default Templates

To set company-wide default templates:

1. Navigate to **Event Media**
2. Select the **Settings** tab
3. Under **Select a default event media to use for your customers**, choose your default printable template
4. Optionally, expand each item type (tickets, products, season tickets, guest lists) to set type-specific defaults
5. Click **Save**

<Note>
The settings page also controls [mobile wallet pass](/core-platform/event-management/event-media/mobile-wallets) defaults and whether mobile wallet downloads are enabled.
</Note>

### Overriding Templates Per Event

To assign a different template to a specific event, configure it in the event's settings. The event-level assignment overrides the company and venue defaults for all items on that event. You can also set item-type-specific overrides at the event level — for example, using one template for tickets and a different one for products on the same event.

### Overriding Templates Per Sale Item

For the most granular control, individual sale items can have their own template assignment. This overrides all other levels and is useful when a specific ticket type needs a unique design — such as a VIP ticket with a distinct layout.

## Managing Templates

### Navigating to Event Media

Navigate to **Event Media** from the main admin navigation. The page displays all your templates organised by type, with tabs for **Printables**, **Apple Passes**, **Gift Vouchers**, **Cover Sheets**, and **Settings**.

### Creating a Template

1. Select the tab for the type of template you want to create
2. Click **Create**
3. Choose a starting point:
   - **Pre-built template** — Select from templates like **Detailed ticket**, **Small ticket**, or **Blank ticket** to start with a ready-made layout
   - **Import** — Upload a `.nuem` file to import a template exported from another account
4. If starting from a blank template, choose a paper size (see [Paper sizes](/core-platform/event-management/event-media/custom-pdfs#paper-sizes))
5. Use the template designer to build your layout
6. Click **Save**, enter a name, and confirm

### Editing a Template

Click any template on the event media listing to open it in the template designer. Changes are saved when you click **Save**.

### Previewing a Template

After saving a template at least once, use the **Preview** button in the designer to see how it will look with sample data. You can customise the preview text using **Set preview texts** to test different data scenarios.

### Deleting a Template

Delete a template from the event media listing. Any events, items, or sale items that were using the deleted template will revert to the next template in the assignment hierarchy.

<Warning>
Deleting a template cannot be undone. All assignments using that template will fall back to the next available default.
</Warning>

### Exporting and Importing Templates

Templates can be exported as `.nuem` files and imported into other accounts. This is useful for sharing branded designs across organisations or backing up templates.

The API provides endpoints to [retrieve event media templates](/api-reference/event-media/retrieve-event-medias) and [generate download links](/api-reference/event-media/generate-event-media-link) for programmatic access to ticket PDFs and passes.

## Box Office Visibility

Printable templates can be marked as **Visible in Box Office**, which makes them available for selection when printing tickets from the box office interface. This is useful when box office staff need to choose between different print formats — for example, selecting a thermal printer template versus a standard A4 template depending on the printer in use.
