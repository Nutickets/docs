## Overview

Mobile wallet passes let your customers save their tickets directly to **Apple Wallet** on their iPhone. Instead of downloading a PDF and keeping track of a file, customers tap a button and the ticket appears in their Wallet app — ready to present at entry by showing the QR code on their phone screen.

Wallet passes are an alternative to [PDF tickets](/core-platform/event-management/event-media/custom-pdfs), not a replacement. Both can be available simultaneously, giving customers the choice of how they want to access their tickets.

<Note>
Mobile wallet passes currently support **Apple Wallet only**. There is no Google Wallet integration at this time.

## Enabling Mobile Wallet Passes

Mobile wallet downloads are controlled at multiple levels. The setting can be enabled or disabled at each level, and the platform checks them in order until it finds a configured value:

| Level | Setting |
|-------|---------|
| **Sale item** | Override for a specific sale item |
| **Event** | Override for all items on a specific event |
| **Venue** | Override for all events at a venue |
| **Company** | Account-wide default |

To enable mobile wallet passes at the company level:

1. Navigate to **Event Media**
2. Select the **Settings** tab
3. Set **Enable mobile wallet downloads** to enabled
4. Click **Save**

Events, venues, and individual sale items can override this setting to enable or disable wallet passes independently. For example, you might enable wallet passes company-wide but disable them for a specific event that requires printed tickets.

<Note>
Mobile wallet passes are available for **tickets**, **products**, and **season tickets**. Gift vouchers cannot be added to Apple Wallet.
</Note>

## What Customers See

When mobile wallet passes are enabled, customers see an **Add to Apple Wallet** button on their ticket download page alongside the PDF download option.

### On iPhone (iOS / Safari)

Tapping the **Add to Apple Wallet** button downloads the pass directly. The customer's iPhone prompts them to add it to their Wallet app, where it appears alongside boarding passes, loyalty cards, and other passes.

### On Other Devices

For customers using Android or desktop browsers, tapping the button opens a modal with a **QR code**. The customer scans this QR code with an iPhone to add the pass to their Apple Wallet. The modal displays the message **Scan code with iPhone to add to your Apple Wallet**.

<Note>
The QR code option is only available for orders with 20 or fewer items, to ensure reliable performance.
</Note>

## Pass Types and Layouts

Apple Wallet supports several pass layouts. When creating an Apple Pass template, you choose a **pass type** that determines the overall structure:

| Pass Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Event ticket** | Standard event ticket layout — the most common choice for events |
| **Boarding pass** | Airline boarding pass style with departure/arrival layout |
| **Generic pass** | Flexible layout suitable for memberships or general passes |
| **Store card** | Loyalty or store card format |

Some pass types offer **variants** that change how images and content are arranged:

| Pass Type | Variant | Image Display |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Event ticket** | Strip | Wide banner image behind the primary fields |
| **Event ticket** | Background | Full background image behind the entire pass |
| **Generic pass** | Rectangular | Rectangular thumbnail beside the fields |
| **Generic pass** | Square | Square thumbnail beside the fields |

## Customising a Pass Design

### Creating an Apple Pass Template

1. Navigate to **Event Media**
2. Select the **Apple Passes** tab
3. Click **Create**
4. Choose the **Event Pass** template as a starting point
5. Configure the pass type, colours, and images
6. Click **Save**, enter a name, and confirm

### Colours

Each pass design has three colour settings:

| Setting | Controls |
|---------|----------|
| **Background colour** | The main card background |
| **Foreground colour** | Primary text colour |
| **Label colour** | Secondary text colour for labels and helper text |

Colours are set using colour pickers in the pass configuration form.

**Automatic background colour:** Enable **Automatic background colour** to have the pass background colour inherited from the ticket type's tag colour in your seating plan. This is useful for events with colour-coded sections — each ticket type can automatically appear in its assigned colour.

### Images

Depending on the pass type and variant, you can upload different images:

| Image | Dimensions | Where It Appears |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Icon** | 29 × 29 pt | Lock screen notifications and email previews |
| **Logo** | 160 × 50 pt | Top-left corner of the pass, next to the organisation name |
| **Strip image** | 375 × 144 pt | Banner behind the primary fields (Event ticket — strip variant) |
| **Background image** | 180 × 220 pt | Behind the entire front of the pass (Event ticket — background variant) |
| **Thumbnail** | 90 × 90 pt | Beside the fields (Generic — rectangular/square variants) |
| **Footer image** | 286 × 15 pt | Near the barcode (Boarding pass only) |

**Automatic images:** Two auto-detection options save you from uploading duplicate images:

- **Automatic strip image** — Inherits the event's header image, so each event's pass automatically uses its page banner
- **Automatic thumbnail image** — Inherits the event's card thumbnail image

When auto-detection is enabled, you don't need to upload separate images for each event — the pass design automatically picks up the event's existing images.

## Pass Content

The pass content is generated automatically from the order and event data. Depending on the pass layout, the following information appears on the pass:

- **Event name** — Displayed prominently as the primary field
- **Date and time** — Event start date and time
- **Venue** — Venue name
- **Seat information** — Row, seat, block, or area details (for seated events)
- **Customer name** — The ticket holder's name
- **QR code** — Scannable barcode for entry

The back of the pass can include additional details such as the full venue address.

### Location Awareness

If the venue has coordinates configured, the pass includes location data. When the customer is near the venue, their iPhone can surface the pass automatically on the lock screen — making it easy to find at entry time.

## Assigning Pass Templates

Apple Pass templates follow the same [assignment hierarchy](/core-platform/event-management/event-media/overview#assigning-templates) as printable templates. The platform resolves which pass design to use by checking:

1. **Sale item** — Specific sale item override
2. **Item type per event** — Type-specific override (ticket, product, season ticket, guest list)
3. **Event** — Event-wide default
4. **Venue** — Venue default
5. **Item type (company)** — Company-wide type-specific default
6. **Company** — Company-wide default
7. **System default** — Built-in default pass design

Configure defaults in **Event Media > Settings** under the Apple Pass sections. Override per event or sale item in their respective settings.

## Secure Barcodes

Unlike [PDF downloads](/core-platform/event-management/event-media/custom-pdfs#secure-barcodes-and-pdf-downloads), Apple Wallet passes **fully support secure barcodes**. Because the pass is a live digital document on the customer's phone, the barcode can refresh dynamically. There is no need to convert to static barcodes when using wallet passes.

This makes wallet passes the preferred download method for events using secure barcodes, as they maintain the anti-fraud protection that secure barcodes provide.

## Limitations

- **Apple Wallet only** — No Google Wallet integration. Android users can still view the QR code to scan with an iPhone
- **No gift vouchers** — Gift vouchers cannot be added to Apple Wallet
- **Single item per pass** — Each ticket generates its own individual pass
- **QR code limit** — The QR code download option (for non-iOS users) is only available for orders with 20 or fewer items
