## Overview

Cover sheets are optional pages that can be included at the beginning of a PDF ticket download. They're primarily used for postal delivery — providing a printable page with the recipient's address, order details, and event information that can be placed on top of the printed tickets before mailing.

Cover sheets are available exclusively through the **box office** download interface. When box office staff download tickets for an order, they can optionally select one or more cover sheets to prepend to the PDF.

## When to Use Cover Sheets

Cover sheets are useful when:

- **Posting tickets** — Include the recipient's delivery address on a cover page so staff can fold and mail the tickets
- **Organising printed orders** — Add a cover page that identifies the order and purchaser for easier handling
- **Including instructions** — Add custom text with entry instructions, parking details, or other information alongside the tickets

## Pre-Built Templates

Three cover sheet templates are available as starting points:

| Template | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Cover sheet** | Standard cover page with event details, order information, and customisable text areas |
| **Address sheet** | Focused on delivery address display — designed for windowed envelopes or mailing labels |
| **Blank cover** | Empty canvas for building a fully custom cover sheet |

## Creating a Cover Sheet

Cover sheets are created in the same template designer used for [printable ticket templates](/core-platform/event-management/event-media/custom-pdfs):

1. Navigate to **Event Media**
2. Select the **Cover Sheets** tab
3. Click **Create**
4. Choose a starting template (**Cover sheet**, **Address sheet**, or **Blank cover**)
5. Customise the layout using the template designer
6. Click **Save**, enter a name, and confirm

Cover sheets use A4 page dimensions (210 × 297 mm) and support all the same design objects as printable templates — text, images, shapes, and QR codes.

### Available Fields

Cover sheet templates support all the same dynamic fields as ticket templates, including:

- **Purchaser name** and **delivery address** — Essential for postal delivery
- **Order reference** and **completion date** — For identifying the order
- **Event name**, **date**, **time**, and **venue** — Event details for context
- **Organiser information** — Company or organiser details
- **Data capture question answers** — Any responses collected during checkout

See [Dynamic fields](/core-platform/event-management/event-media/custom-pdfs#dynamic-fields) for the full list of available placeholders.

## Selecting a Cover Sheet at Download

When downloading tickets from the box office, staff can choose to include a cover sheet:

1. Open the order in the box office
2. Select the items to download
3. In the download options, under **Select your cover sheet(s)**, choose from available cover sheets — each displayed as a preview card showing the template's layout
4. To skip the cover sheet, select **No cover sheet**
5. Click **Download as PDF**

The selected cover sheet(s) appear as the first page(s) of the generated PDF, followed by the ticket pages. The cover sheet is populated with the order's actual data — delivery address, purchaser name, event details, and any other fields included in the template.

<Note>
Cover sheet selection is only available in the box office download interface. Customers downloading their own tickets through the standard download page do not see cover sheet options.
</Note>

## Multiple Cover Sheets

You can select more than one cover sheet for a single download. Each selected cover sheet generates its own page at the beginning of the PDF. This is useful if you need different information on separate pages — for example, an address page for the envelope and an instructions page for the customer.
