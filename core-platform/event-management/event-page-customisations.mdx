## Overview

Event page customisations control how individual event pages appear to customers on your ticket shop. You can configure:

- Header and thumbnail images
- Content blocks (text, galleries, videos, maps, and more)
- What information is displayed (dates, times, location, pricing)
- SEO and social sharing settings
- Custom button text and capacity messaging

Access page customisation from the event dashboard by selecting **Customise Page** or navigating to the page settings section.

## Images

### Header Image

The header image appears as a banner at the top of the event page.

- Supports multiple locales for multilingual sites
- Recommended aspect ratio: 2:1
- Minimum dimensions: 300px height, 600px width
- If no image is uploaded, a default image is used

### Thumbnail Image

The thumbnail image appears in event listings, search results, and when events are grouped.

- Same dimension requirements as header images
- Used on listing pages and event cards
- Falls back to a default image if not set

## Content Blocks

Content blocks are modular sections that make up the body of your event page. You can add, remove, reorder, and configure blocks to build your page layout.

## Applying to Scheduled Events

When editing page settings for an event that's part of a [schedule](/core-platform/event-management/schedules), you can choose to apply changes to:

This enables bulk updates to page customisations across recurring events.
