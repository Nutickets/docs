title: 'Sale Item Groups'
description: 'Organise tickets into collapsible groups on the event page with independent stock limits, sale periods, and display controls.'

## Overview

- Sale item groups allow you to organise tickets into named, collapsible sections on the event page with shared stock pools.
- Only ticket-type sale items can be placed in a group. Products, guest lists, donations, and other item types are not supported.
- Tickets that belong to a [timeslot](/core-platform/event-management/timeslots) cannot be placed in a group.
- Each group can have its own stock limit and [sale period](#sale-periods), independent of the individual tickets within it.
- Groups are managed from the event dashboard and appear as collapsible sections on the customer-facing event page.
- Group names and descriptions are translatable.

<Note>
  Sale item groups require the sale item groups feature to be enabled for your
  company.

## Use Cases

<Accordion title="Phased ticket releases">
  Create separate groups for each release phase — for example, "Early Bird",
  "General Release", and "Last Chance". Give each group its own sale period and
  enable **hide when off sale** so only the active phase is visible to customers
  at any given time.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Shared capacity across ticket types">
  A VIP area has a fixed capacity of 200, but you offer VIP Adult, VIP Child,
  and VIP Concession tickets. Place all three in a group with a stock limit of
  200. Customers can purchase any combination, but total sales across the group
  cannot exceed the shared limit.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Capping sales to a finite resource">
  A kayaking experience offers Adult and Child tickets, but the real constraint
  is the 30 kayaks available — not the number of people. Place both ticket types
  in a group with a stock limit of 30. Each purchase deducts from the shared
  pool regardless of ticket type, ensuring you never oversell beyond the
  available equipment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Limited allocation for a partner or sponsor">
  A sponsor is allocated 50 tickets to distribute. Create a group with a stock
  limit of 50 containing the relevant tickets. Once the allocation is used, the
  group sells out independently of the event's overall capacity. Enable **hide
  when out of stock** to remove it from the event page automatically.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Organising a complex event page">
  An event with many ticket types can become overwhelming. Group related tickets
  into labelled sections — for example, "Standing", "Balcony", and "Accessible
  Seating" — and set less popular sections to **collapsed by default** to keep
  the page focused.
</Accordion>

## Creating a Group

Groups are created from the event dashboard by clicking **Add sale item group**.

When creating a group, you can optionally select existing tickets to place into it. Tickets can also be moved into or out of groups after creation using drag-and-drop on the event dashboard.

If the event belongs to a [schedule](/core-platform/event-management/schedules), you can apply the new group to other events in the same schedule during creation.

## Configuration

| Field                    | Description                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**                 | The group name displayed to customers on the event page. Translatable.                                          |
| **Description**          | Optional descriptive text for the group. Translatable.                                                          |
| **Collapsed by default** | When enabled, the group starts collapsed on the event page. Customers can expand it to view the tickets inside. |
| **External ID**          | Optional identifier for referencing the group in third-party systems. Must be unique.                           |

## Stock Management

Groups can optionally enforce their own stock limit, separate from individual ticket stock.

| Field               | Description                                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unlimited stock** | When enabled, the group has no stock limit — availability is determined solely by the individual tickets.            |
| **Total stock**     | When unlimited stock is disabled, sets the maximum number of items that can be sold across all tickets in the group. |

<Note>
  Group stock is tracked independently. When a ticket in the group is purchased,
  group stock is deducted. If the group runs out of stock, no further tickets in
  the group can be sold — even if individual tickets still have
  [availability](/core-platform/event-management/capacity-controls).
</Note>

## Sale Periods

Groups support their own sale window, controlling when the tickets within them are available for purchase.

| Field                      | Description                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **On sale from**           | The date and time the group becomes available. Before this time, the group is off sale.    |
| **On sale until**          | The date and time the group goes off sale.                                                 |
| **Hide when off sale**     | When enabled, the entire group is hidden from the event page when outside its sale period. |
| **Hide when out of stock** | When enabled, the entire group is hidden from the event page when its stock is exhausted.  |

A group can also be manually toggled on or off sale from the event dashboard without changing its sale period dates.

## Managing Groups on the Event Dashboard

### Reordering

Tickets and groups can be reordered on the event dashboard using drag-and-drop. You can:

- Reorder tickets within a group.
- Move tickets between groups.
- Move tickets out of a group into the ungrouped section.
- Reorder groups relative to each other.

### Deleting a Group

- A group cannot be deleted if it still contains tickets. Move or remove all tickets from the group first.
- A group that has sales cannot be deleted. It is taken off sale instead.

## Customer Experience

On the event page, groups appear as collapsible sections containing their tickets. Groups set to **collapsed by default** are initially collapsed — customers click to expand them.

Groups that are off sale or out of stock can be automatically hidden from the event page based on the group's [display settings](#sale-periods).

## Schedule Synchronisation

When an event belongs to a [schedule](/core-platform/event-management/schedules), groups can be synchronised across events in that schedule:

- **Creating a group** — optionally apply it to other events in the schedule.
- **Updating a group** — optionally apply changes to related groups across the schedule. Updates are processed in the background.
- **Assigning an existing group** — copy a group from one event to other events in the schedule.

Groups created or assigned across a schedule are automatically linked, so future bulk updates can target all related groups at once.

## Data Import

Sale item groups can be bulk-imported via CSV from **Admin > Data Imports**. The import can optionally associate existing tickets with their respective groups.

An **automatically associate similar groups** option attempts to link groups with the same name across events in the same schedule, enabling bulk updates. Alternatively, you can manually set parent relationships using `parent_id` or `external_parent_id` values in the import file.

See [data imports](/core-platform/data-imports/introduction) for details.
