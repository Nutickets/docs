## Overview

- Capacity in the platform is controlled at multiple levels, not just one field.
- A single purchase can be limited by event capacity, item-type capacity, timeslot stock, sale item group stock, sale item stock, inventory (global) stock, and seating-plan space availability.
- This page centralises how those controls relate to each other.

## Capacity Layers

| Layer | What it limits | Key controls |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Event (all item types)** | Total sales volume across the event | `Total Capacity` |
| **Event (item-type capacity)** | Sales volume for specific item types | `Total Ticket Capacity`, `Total Product Capacity`, `Total Guest List Capacity`, `Total Donation Capacity` |
| **Timeslot** | Sales volume inside a timeslot | `Time slot stock` (`Limited to` / `Unlimited`) |
| **Sale item group** | Combined stock across grouped ticket sale items | Group `Total capacity` (`Limited to` / `Unlimited`) |
| **Sale item** | Stock for a specific sale item instance | `Initial stock` on creation; allocated stock on inventory item edit |
| **Inventory item (global)** | Shared stock across linked sale items | `Global stock` (`Limited to` / `Unlimited`) |
| **Seating plan spaces** | Seat or general admission (GA) availability | Seat/GA space availability records generated from seating-plan schema |

## How Availability Is Evaluated

### 1. Sale Item Stock Resolution

For a non-seated sale item, the platform calculates saleable stock as the lowest applicable remaining stock across:

- Sale item group stock (if the item is in a group)
- Inventory/global item stock (when the sale item uses global stock)
- Sale item stock (if explicitly set)
- Timeslot stock (if the item belongs to a timeslot)
- Bundled child item stock (for bundles)

In practice, the most restrictive layer wins.

### 2. Seating Availability (Seated Events)

For seated events, seat/GA space availability is an additional constraint:

- Standard seats are imported as single-capacity spaces.
- General admission blocks use block capacity from the seating-plan schema (when set).
- Space status (`available`, `unavailable`, `hidden`, `restricted`) is separate from stock quantity and can block purchase even when quantity remains.

### 3. Event Capacity Validation

During basket validation, event-level checks run separately from item/timeslot/group stock checks:

- Overall event capacity is validated.
- Ticket capacity can be enforced specifically when `Take off sale if no ticket capacity remains` is enabled.
- Item-type capacities are validated by item type (ticket/product/guest list/donation).

This means a sale item can still have stock remaining but be blocked by event capacity.

## Event Capacity Controls

Event-level capacity fields:

- **Total Capacity**
- **Total Ticket Capacity**
- **Total Product Capacity**
- **Total Guest List Capacity**
- **Total Donation Capacity**

Related settings:

- **Ticket capacity includes season tickets**
- **Take off sale if no ticket capacity remains**

### Season Ticket Behaviour

- When `Ticket capacity includes season tickets` is enabled, season ticket sales are included in ticket-capacity checks.
- Schedule logic also checks related schedule events where the same season ticket can consume ticket capacity.

## Timeslot Stock

- Timeslots support their own stock limit (`Time slot stock`).
- `Unlimited` removes timeslot stock limits; `Limited to` sets a finite cap.
- Timeslot stock does not replace event or item stock controls. Event capacity and item stock can still be the limiting factor.

## Sale Item Group Capacity

- Sale item groups can define a group-level capacity that grouped sale items cannot exceed.
- Group capacity is independent of each sale item’s own stock setting.
- Grouping constraints:
  - Sale item groups are ticket-only.
  - Timeslot sale items cannot be assigned to sale item groups.

## Sale Item And Inventory Stock

### Inventory (Global) Stock

- Inventory items can have a global stock limit (`Global stock`), shared by linked sale items.
- If global stock is unlimited, linked sale items can still be limited by their own stock or other layers.

### Allocated Sale Item Stock

- Each linked sale item can either:
  - use global stock, or
  - have an explicit allocated stock value.
- Allocated sale item stock cannot be set higher than a finite global stock limit.

## Unlimited vs Limited

- For stock/capacity types in this page, no availability record means unlimited.
- Setting a value creates/updates a finite availability record.
- Switching to `Unlimited` removes that limit record.

## Sold/Reserved Floor Protection

When a finite limit is updated, the platform does not allow effective capacity below already sold + reserved quantity.

- Event capacities are clamped to at least sold + reserved totals.
- Timeslot stock is clamped to at least sold + reserved totals.
- Inventory and sale item stock updates are clamped similarly.
- Sale item group recalculations also enforce the same floor.

## Troubleshooting Capacity Issues

If an item appears unavailable unexpectedly, check in this order:

1. Event overall capacity and item-type capacity.
2. Timeslot stock (if assigned).
3. Sale item group stock (if assigned).
4. Sale item allocated stock and whether it uses global stock.
5. Inventory global stock.
6. For seated events, seat/GA space availability and status.
