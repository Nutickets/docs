## Overview

- A venue represents a physical location where events take place.
- Venues are required when creating [in-venue or hybrid events](/core-platform/event-management/introduction#event-types). Online-only events do not require a venue.
- Each venue stores address information, geolocation coordinates, and optional capacity details.
- [Seating plans](/core-platform/seating-plans/introduction) belong to a venue. When [attaching a seating plan to an event](/core-platform/event-management/seated-events), only plans belonging to the event's venue are available for selection.
- Venues can be assigned [visibility groups](/core-platform/system-access/visibility-groups) to control which admin users can see and manage them.
- Venue information is translatable — name, address, postcode, and region can be provided in multiple languages.

## Creating a Venue

Venues are created via **Admin > Events > Venues > Add new venue**.

A venue can also be created inline during event creation when selecting a venue in the event wizard.

## Configuration

### Address Information

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | The venue name. Translatable. |
| **Address** | The street address. Can be populated via Google Places address search or entered manually. Translatable. |
| **City** | The city where the venue is located. Translatable. |
| **Region** | The region or state. Translatable. |
| **Country** | The country where the venue is located. |
| **Postcode** | The postal code. Translatable. |

<Note>
When Google Places is enabled, searching for an address auto-populates the address, city, region, country, postcode, and map coordinates. You can switch to manual entry at any time.
</Note>

### Location & Map

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Latitude / Longitude** | GPS coordinates for the venue. Set automatically via address search or manually entered. |
| **Map zoom level** | Controls the default zoom level when the venue's map is displayed. Range: 3–21. |
| **What3Words address** | A [What3Words](https://what3words.com/) location reference (e.g. `///filled.count.soap`). When provided, the W3W address is included in confirmation emails, Apple Wallet passes, and printable tickets. |

The map preview shows an interactive Google Map with a draggable marker. At zoom levels above 17, a What3Words grid overlay is displayed when a W3W API key is configured.

### Venue Settings

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Capacity** | The total capacity of the venue. Optional. This value is available in reports but does not enforce any capacity limits on events — use [event capacity controls](/core-platform/event-management/capacity-controls) for that. |
| **External ID** | An optional identifier for referencing the venue in third-party systems. Must be unique across the company. Exposed in the API and used during [data imports](/core-platform/data-imports/introduction). |
| **Card image** | An image used when event listing blocks are grouped by venue. Translatable. |
| **Visibility groups** | Controls which admin users can view and manage this venue. Users without access to a venue's visibility group cannot see it or its associated events. |

### Event Media

<Note>
This section is only available when the event media feature is enabled for your company.
</Note>

Venues can be assigned default [event media](/core-platform/event-media/overview) templates. These serve as fallback templates for all events at the venue — if an event does not specify its own media templates, the venue's templates are used.

Templates can be configured per item type:

| Item Type | Printable Template | Apple Pass Template |
|-----------|--------------------|---------------------|
| **Default** | General printable | General Apple Pass |
| **Tickets** | Ticket-specific printable | Ticket-specific Apple Pass |
| **Guest lists** | Guest list printable | Guest list Apple Pass |
| **Products** | Product printable | Product Apple Pass |
| **Season tickets** | Season ticket printable | Season ticket Apple Pass |

A **mobile wallet passes** toggle controls whether Apple Wallet passes are generated for items at this venue.

## Venue Display on Event Pages

How venue information appears on the public event page is controlled per event via [event page customisations](/core-platform/event-management/event-page-customisations), not on the venue itself. There are three options:

| Setting | Behaviour |
|---------|-----------|
| **Show all** | Displays the venue name, full address, and What3Words link (if set). A map is shown on the event page. |
| **Show venue only** | Displays the venue name without the address. |
| **Hide** | Venue information is not displayed on the event page. |

## Seating Plans

- A venue can have multiple [seating plans](/core-platform/seating-plans/introduction), allowing different layouts for different events at the same location.
- Events using a venue with seating plans can [attach one of those plans](/core-platform/event-management/seated-events) to become a seated event.

<Note>
To create a seating plan, you must have permission to view or create at least one venue.
</Note>

## Managing Venues

### Venue List

The venue list (**Admin > Events > Venues**) displays all venues with their name, address, capacity, and assigned visibility groups.

The list supports the following filters:

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | Search venues by name (partial match). |
| **Visibility group** | Filter by a specific visibility group. |
| **City** | Filter by city. |
| **Events** | Filter by event status: venues with future events, past events only, or no events. |
| **Created date** | Filter by creation date range. |
| **Trashed** | Show soft-deleted venues. |

### Deleting and Restoring

- Venues are soft-deleted — they can be restored after deletion.
- A venue cannot be deleted if it is associated with an event.
- Deleted venues can be found using the **Trashed** filter and restored from the venue list.

## Data Import

Venues can be bulk-imported via CSV from **Admin > Data Imports**. The minimum required fields are a venue name and an address. Optional import fields include city, region, country, postcode, latitude, longitude, capacity, external ID, and visibility groups.

Visibility groups referenced in the import must already exist in the system. See [data imports](/core-platform/data-imports/introduction) for details.

## Relationships

| Relationship | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **[Events](/core-platform/event-management/introduction)** | A venue can host many events. In-venue and hybrid events require a venue. |
| **[Seating plans](/core-platform/seating-plans/introduction)** | A venue can have multiple seating plans for different event layouts. |
| **[Visibility groups](/core-platform/system-access/visibility-groups)** | Control admin access to the venue and its events. |
| **[Event media](/core-platform/event-media/overview)** | Default printable and Apple Pass templates applied to events at the venue. |
| **[Schedules](/core-platform/event-scheduling/core-concepts)** | Multiple events within a schedule can share the same venue. |
| **[Reports](/core-platform/reporting/fundamentals)** | Venue name, address, and capacity are available as report fields and filters. |
