title: "Item Transfers"
description: "How customers and admins can transfer purchased items between users, including sharing during checkout, post-purchase transfers, and compulsory sharing."
---

## Overview

- Item transfers allow purchased items (tickets, products, gift vouchers) to be reassigned from one customer to another.
- The platform uses the term **sharing** in customer-facing interfaces and **transferring** in admin interfaces — both refer to the same underlying mechanism.
- Transfers can happen **during checkout** (before payment) or **after purchase** (from the customer's account or by an admin).
- When sharing restrictions and [purchase limits](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts) are configured, the platform can enforce **compulsory transfers** — requiring customers to share excess items before completing their order.
- Transferred items are fully reassigned to the recipient, including access control validity. By default, a new barcode is generated for the recipient.

## Use Cases

<Accordion title="Group bookings with per-customer limits">
  An event limits each customer to 2 tickets. A customer purchasing 6 tickets for a group is required to share 4 of them during checkout. The platform enforces this via compulsory transfers, preventing the order from completing until all excess items are assigned to other people.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Corporate ticket distribution">
  A company purchases a block of tickets and uses [order distributions](/core-platform/advanced/order-distributions) to share them with employees via a passcode-protected link or QR code. Each employee claims their own tickets without the purchaser needing to enter individual details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Gift purchases">
  A customer buys a ticket as a gift and enters the recipient's name and email during checkout. The recipient receives a "claim your items" email and can access the ticket from their own account. Transfers can be scheduled for a future date (e.g. a birthday).
</Accordion>

## Sharing Restrictions

Sharing restrictions control **when** customers can transfer items. These are configured at the event level and can be overridden per [sale item](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts).

### Event-Level Configuration

Sharing restrictions are set separately for **tickets** and **products** on the event dashboard under **Sharing Restrictions**.

| Option | Behaviour |
|--------|-----------|
| **Only during the checkout process** | Customers can share items while completing their purchase, but not after. |
| **Only once their order is complete** | Customers can share items from their account after purchase, but not during checkout. |
| **At any point, during or after purchase** | Customers can share items at any time. |
| **Never** | Sharing is disabled entirely. |

### Sale-Item-Level Override

Individual sale items can override the event-level sharing restriction. The same options are available, plus:

| Option | Behaviour |
|--------|-----------|
| **Inherit event settings** | Uses the event-level restriction (default for new items). |
| **Sharing is compulsory** | Every unit of this item must be transferred to someone else — the purchaser cannot keep any for themselves. |

<Note>
[Gift vouchers](/core-platform/sale-items/gift-vouchers) are always shareable during checkout regardless of sharing restriction settings. [Guest list](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts) items cannot be shared.
</Note>

## Transfer Flow

### During Checkout

When sharing is enabled during checkout, a **Sharing** step appears in the checkout flow before payment.

For each shareable item, the customer can:
- **Keep it** — the item stays assigned to the purchaser.
- **Share with someone else** — enter the recipient's name and email, or generate a shareable URL.

Shared items trigger a "claim your items" email to the recipient on the specified date. The recipient clicks a link to claim the item into their account.

**Scheduled transfers**: Customers can choose to share immediately or set a future date. The notification email is sent when the transfer date arrives.

### After Purchase

When sharing is enabled after purchase, customers can transfer items from their account via **My Account**.

- Only items marked as shareable after purchase can be transferred.
- Items that have already been scanned for [access control](/core-platform/event-management/access-control) cannot be transferred.
- If the **Only purchaser can transfer items** company setting is enabled, only the original order purchaser can initiate transfers — recipients cannot re-transfer items.

### Claiming Transfers

When a transfer is initiated, the recipient receives a "claim your items" email containing:
- The sender's name
- The items being transferred
- A **Claim now** button linking to the shop

The recipient must create an account (or log in) to claim their items. Once claimed, the items appear in the recipient's account and are removed from the sender's.

<Warning>
Once an item is claimed, the transfer cannot be undone. The only way to return an item is for the recipient to initiate a new transfer back to the original purchaser.
</Warning>

## Compulsory Transfers

Compulsory transfers are enforced automatically when a customer's order would exceed configured limits. The customer **must** share excess items before completing checkout.

Compulsory transfers are triggered by:

- **Per-item purchase limits** — A [sale item's](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts) `purchase limit per customer` is exceeded.
- **Per-event ticket limits** — The event's `maximum tickets per customer` is exceeded across all ticket types.
- **Prerequisite items** — If an item has [prerequisites](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts) and the transferred items would leave the purchaser without the required prerequisite, those prerequisites must also be transferred.

Compulsory transfer items appear pre-assigned to "someone else" in the sharing step and cannot be switched back to the purchaser. They must be shared immediately — scheduled transfers are not allowed for compulsory items.

<Note>
[Box office](/core-platform/box-office/introduction) users with the appropriate permissions can bypass purchase limit restrictions and compulsory transfer requirements.
</Note>

## Ticket Renaming (Named Holders)

Ticket renaming allows a name to be assigned to a ticket **without** transferring it. The ticket remains in the purchaser's account, but displays the named holder's details.

This is configured on the event dashboard under **Sharing Restrictions** and requires the **Named Holders** feature to be enabled for the company.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Shop">
    Controls ticket renaming behaviour during online checkout:
    - **Disabled** — No renaming allowed.
    - **Enabled** — Customers can optionally assign names during checkout.
    - **Mandatory** — Customers must assign a name to every ticket before completing checkout.

    When enabled or mandatory, an **Allow ticket renaming after checkout** toggle controls whether customers can change the name from their account after purchase.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Box Office">
    Controls ticket renaming behaviour in [box office mode](/core-platform/box-office/introduction):
    - **Disabled** — No renaming allowed.
    - **Enabled** — Box office users can optionally assign names.
    - **Mandatory** — Box office users must assign a name to every ticket.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Admin Transfer Management

Admins can manage transfers for any order from the admin panel under the order's **Transfer Items** section.

### Transferable Items

Lists all items in the order that can be transferred. Admins can:
- Enter a recipient's name and email to initiate a transfer.
- Choose to share immediately or on a scheduled date.
- Optionally claim the transfer immediately on behalf of the recipient.

### Pending Transfers

Shows transfers that have been initiated but not yet claimed. Admins can:
- **Claim** a transfer on behalf of the recipient.
- **Cancel** a pending transfer, returning the item to the original holder.

### Transfer History

Displays all completed transfers with the date, original barcode, sender, and recipient.

<Note>
Items that are currently listed for [resale](/core-platform/resale/configuration) cannot be transferred. If an item has been paired with an NFC tag, the pairing is removed on transfer and the recipient must pair again.
</Note>

## Company-Level Settings

These settings apply across all events and are configured at the company level.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Enable instant transfers** | Transferred items on completed orders are automatically claimed without the recipient needing to take action. Recipients still receive the claim notification but do not need to act on it. |
| **Preserve barcodes on instant transfer** | When instant transfers are enabled, the original barcode is kept instead of generating a new one. Only available when instant transfers are enabled. |
| **Allow transfer corrections** | Allows the purchaser to modify or cancel transfers even after completing checkout, regardless of the current sharing restriction settings. |
| **Only purchaser can transfer items** | Only the original order purchaser can initiate transfers. Recipients cannot re-transfer items they have received. |

<Warning>
Preserving barcodes on transfer means the original holder's barcode remains valid. If the original holder scans in before the recipient, the recipient's entry may be blocked.
</Warning>

## Cancelling Transfers

Pending transfers (not yet claimed) can be cancelled by:
- The **customer** who initiated the transfer, from their account.
- An **admin** from the order's transfer management section.

Cancelling a transfer keeps the item in the original holder's account. Any associated wallet transfers (e.g. for gift vouchers) are also cancelled.

Claimed transfers cannot be cancelled or reversed.
