## Overview

Each import type has its own set of fields and optional settings. This page provides a detailed reference for every available import type — what fields are supported, which values are required, and how to format your data.

Every import type provides a **Download template** button on the type selection page. The template CSV contains the correct column headers for that type — use it as a starting point for preparing your data.

<Note>
All fields listed for an import type must be present as columns in your CSV file (they must be mapped during the header mapping step). However, most fields accept empty values — only fields marked as requiring a value must contain data in each row. When in doubt, download the template and refer to the field descriptions shown during import setup.
</Note>

### Formatting Conventions

These formatting patterns apply across multiple import types:

| Format | Example | Used For |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Date/time | `2023-11-03 04:00:00` (Y-m-d H:i:s) | Event dates, sale periods, validity windows |
| Boolean | `0` or `1` | Toggles and yes/no fields. If left blank, the default (typically `0`) is assumed |
| Pipe-separated list | `Option A\|\|Option B` | Visibility groups, tag lists, data capture options (separated by `\|\|`) |
| Comma-separated list | `23,56,78` | IDs, email addresses, role names |
| Country | `GB`, `US`, `ES` | ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes. If no match is found, the system attempts to resolve by country name |
| Currency | `GBP`, `EUR`, `USD` | ISO 4217 currency codes |

### Data Capture Columns

Several import types support dynamic data capture columns. Add columns with the header format `DC:field_id` (where `field_id` is the data capture question ID) to include responses for free-text and checkbox question types. Alternatively, use `ExternalDC:external_question_id` to reference questions by their external ID from the Data Capture Question Import. Data capture question IDs can be found under **Data Capture > Questions**.

## Customer Import

Import customer records from an external system. If a customer with the same email address already exists, the existing record is updated rather than creating a duplicate. Customers can also be matched by their internal ID or external ID, with ID taking priority over external ID, and external ID taking priority over email.

### Fields

| Field | Values Required | Description |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| **ID** | No | Internal customer ID. Used to update an existing record — takes priority over External ID and email |
| **External ID** | No | External system identifier for cross-referencing |
| **Name** | No | Full name as a single value (not separate first/last name fields) |
| **E-mail address** | Yes | Customer's email address. Used for sign-in and as a fallback for matching existing records |
| **Date of Birth** | No | Accepted formats: `DD/MM/YYYY`, `YYYY/MM/DD`, or a valid timestamp |
| **Phone** | No | Full phone number |
| **Locale** | No | Two-digit language code (e.g. `en`, `es`, `sa`). If blank, no preference is stored |
| **Address Line 1** | No | First line of the customer's address |
| **Address Line 2** | No | Second line of the customer's address |
| **City** | No | City |
| **Region** | No | Region, state, or province |
| **Postcode** | No | Postal or zip code |
| **Country** | No | Country in ISO2 format (e.g. `GB`, `US`). Falls back to name matching if no ISO2 match is found |
| **Note** | No | A note to attach to the customer record |
| **Customer Groups** | No | Comma-separated list of customer group names. If left empty, the customer is removed from all groups. Requires the **Customer Groups** feature |
| **Account balance currency** | No | Currency code for the account balance. Required together with Account balance addition. Requires the **EPOS** feature |
| **Account balance addition** | No | Initial credit for the account balance. Required together with Account balance currency. Requires the **EPOS** feature |

In addition to the standard fields, you can include data capture responses by adding `DC:field_id` columns to your CSV.

### Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Send customer complete your account e-mails** | When enabled, each imported customer receives an email with a link to set their password and complete their account setup |
| **Additional text for the "complete your account" e-mail** | Custom text that appears at the top of the account completion email. Only available when the email setting is enabled |

<Note>
If address fields are partially provided (e.g. city but no postcode), the address is not saved and a warning is recorded: **Address not saved for this customer due to missing fields: [fields]**.
</Note>

<Note>
When email sending is enabled, emails are dispatched during processing with a short delay between each to manage email throughput.
</Note>

## Order Item Import

The most feature-rich import type. Import order items with full customer, event, sale item, and seating details. Each row creates an order item — rows with the same Order ID are grouped into a single order.
