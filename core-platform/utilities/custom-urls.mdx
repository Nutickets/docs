## Overview

Custom URLs let you replace the standard platform-assigned shop address with your own branded domain. Instead of customers visiting the default platform URL, they can visit `tickets.yourbrand.com` or any domain you own.

This is useful when:
- You want a branded, professional storefront URL
- You need different domains for different languages (e.g. `tickets.example.com` for English, `billets.example.com` for French)
- You want all traffic to route through a single branded domain rather than the default platform URL

## Configuring Custom URLs

Custom URLs are managed in **General Settings**.

1. Navigate to your admin **General Settings**
2. Enable **Custom URLs** if not already enabled
3. Click **Add new URL**
4. Fill in the required fields:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Full URL** | The complete URL including any subdomains. Do not include `http://` or `https://` | `tickets.example.com` |
| **Domain Segment** | The root domain portion of your URL. If no subdomain is used, this is the same as the full URL | `example.com` |
| **Default Language** | Optional — assigns a language to this URL for automatic language-based routing | English, French, etc. |

5. Click **Save**

<Note>
Custom URLs require DNS configuration to point your domain to the platform. Contact support for the DNS records you need to set up before your custom URL will work.
</Note>

## Setting a Primary URL

One custom URL can be designated as the **primary URL**. The primary URL is used as the canonical address for your shop and can optionally redirect all default domain traffic to it.

To set a primary URL, click the **Make Primary** icon next to the URL you want to make primary. Only one URL can be primary at a time — setting a new primary automatically unsets the previous one.

<Note>
Primary URLs cannot have a language assigned. They serve as the default destination for all languages that don't have a language-specific URL configured.
</Note>

## Redirecting Default Domain Traffic

When you have a primary custom URL configured, you can enable **Redirect to primary URL** in General Settings. When enabled, any visitor who arrives via the standard platform domain is automatically redirected to your primary custom URL.

This ensures all customers reach your branded domain regardless of which URL they originally used.

<Note>
This setting only works when a primary custom URL is configured. If no primary URL is set, enabling the redirect has no effect.
</Note>

## Language-Specific URLs

If your shop supports multiple languages, you can assign a language to each non-primary custom URL. When a visitor's language preference matches a URL's assigned language, they are automatically redirected to that URL.

**Example setup:**

| URL | Language | Role |
|-----|----------|------|
| `tickets.example.com` | — | Primary (default for all languages) |
| `billets.example.com` | French | French visitors redirected here |
| `entradas.example.com` | Spanish | Spanish visitors redirected here |

<Note>
Language-based redirects only take effect when visitors access the shop via a custom URL. Visitors browsing via the standard platform URL are not redirected based on language. For this reason, it's recommended to also enable **Redirect to primary URL** when using language-specific URLs.
</Note>

## Validation and Collision Rules

When saving custom URLs, the platform validates each URL to prevent conflicts:

| Check | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **Duplicate custom URL** | Rejected if another company already uses the same custom URL |
| **System domain conflict** | Rejected if the URL matches an existing company alias and reseller domain combination |

If a URL fails validation, an error message explains the conflict so you can choose an alternative.

## Managing Multiple URLs

You can configure multiple custom URLs for your shop. Each URL in the list shows:
- The full URL
- The domain segment
- The assigned language (if any)
- Whether it's the primary URL

To remove a custom URL, click the delete button next to it and save your settings.

<Warning>
After adding or changing custom URLs, test your critical flows — checkout, account login, shared links — to confirm everything works correctly with the new domain. Existing links using the old domain will continue to work only if you keep the previous URL configured or set up a redirect.
</Warning>
