## Overview

Custom URLs let a company serve shop pages from branded domains/subdomains.

## Validation and Collision Rules

When saving custom URLs, the platform checks for conflicts with:

- existing custom URLs used by other companies
- system domain patterns that would clash with reseller/company alias routing

Conflicting URLs are rejected.

## Operational Guidance

- Plan DNS changes before enabling custom URLs.
- Avoid alias/domain combinations that mirror existing reseller domain + company alias patterns.
- Re-test critical flows (checkout, account, links) after domain cutover.
