title: 'Bulk Editing'
description: 'Apply controlled changes across many records (events, timeslots, sale items, and related entities) while preserving guardrails.'

## Overview

Bulk editing is available across multiple modules to reduce repetitive one-by-one updates.

## Typical Bulk Targets

- Events in a schedule.
- Timeslots in an event/schedule.
- Sale items linked by inventory source.
- Multi-record review workflows (for example approvals).

## Best Practice Pattern

1. Start with the smallest safe scope.
2. Use filters to target only intended records.
3. Preview counts where available.
4. Apply and validate on a small sample before large updates.

## Guardrails

- Permission and visibility scopes still apply in bulk operations.
- Some fields are intentionally excluded from bulk edits where data integrity could be harmed.
