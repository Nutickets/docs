## Overview

Sales dashboards give you a real-time operational view of how sales are performing. Rather than running reports and waiting for exports, dashboards show live metrics — orders coming in, revenue accumulating, capacity filling up — updated as activity happens.

There are three dashboard levels, each providing a different perspective:

| Dashboard | What It Shows | When to Use |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Company** | Sales across all your events | Monitoring overall business activity |
| **Event** | Sales for a single event | Checking capacity, revenue, and demand for a specific event |
| **Schedule** | Aggregated sales across a schedule's events | Comparing performance across dates in a recurring series |

## Accessing Sales Dashboards

### Company Dashboard

Navigate to **Sales dashboard** from the main admin dashboard. This shows an overview of sales activity across all your events.

### Event Dashboard

Open an event and click **Sales dashboard** from the event view. This focuses on metrics for that specific event — capacity breakdown, revenue by currency, and item sales.

### Schedule Dashboard

Open a schedule and click **Sales dashboard**. This aggregates sales data across all events in the schedule, letting you compare how different dates or performances are selling.

## Dashboard Widgets

Dashboards are built from widgets — self-contained panels that each show a specific metric. The available widgets are:

| Widget | What It Shows |
|--------|--------------|
| **Waiting Room Status** | Number of active shoppers currently browsing and customers queuing in the waiting room |
| **Order Counts** | Active reservations, completed orders, and abandoned baskets |
| **Order Throughput** | Median time to complete an order and ticket sales per minute, with adjustable duration windows (1, 5, or 15 minutes) |
| **Event Revenue** | Total revenue generated, filterable by item type and currency |
| **Item Sales** | Number of items sold, filterable by item type |
| **Seat Selection Mode** | Breakdown of best available vs manual seat selection, shown as numbers or percentages |
| **Customer Sentiment** | Positive, neutral, and negative checkout feedback breakdown (when feedback is enabled) |

### Customising the Display

Widgets can be rearranged and your layout preferences are saved. Each widget includes filter options (where applicable) to focus on specific item types, currencies, or time windows.

## Live Monitoring

Dashboards are designed for live operational use:

- **Auto-refresh** — when an event is currently on sale, dashboards automatically refresh their data at regular intervals
- **Focus-aware** — data loading pauses when you switch to another browser tab, avoiding unnecessary background requests
- **Real-time indicators** — widgets update independently, so you see the latest data for each metric as it refreshes

## Event Dashboard Details

The event-level dashboard provides the most detailed view, including:

### Capacity Breakdown

A visual breakdown of capacity across price bands showing:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Sold** | Items purchased in completed orders |
| **Reserved** | Items held in active reservations |
| **Complimentary** | Items issued at no charge |
| **Held** | Seats or items held back from sale (if seating plan holds are enabled) |
| **Remaining** | Available capacity |

### Sale Items and Revenue

A detailed listing of each sale item with revenue broken down by currency. This shows exactly which items are generating revenue and how they compare.

## Schedule Dashboard Details

The schedule dashboard aggregates data across all events in a schedule:

- **Events table** — each event in the schedule with its ticket and season ticket distribution
- **Inventory items table** — item-level breakdown with multi-currency revenue columns
- Both tables support pagination for schedules with many events or items

## Dashboards vs Reporting

Sales dashboards and reports serve different purposes:

| | Dashboards | Reports |
|---|-----------|---------|
| **Speed** | Real-time, instant refresh | Generated on demand |
| **Purpose** | Live monitoring, quick health checks | Deep analysis, data export |
| **Filters** | Widget-level toggles | Saved, repeatable filter logic |
| **Output** | On-screen only | Exportable, schedulable, publishable |

Use dashboards when you need to monitor activity as it happens — during an on-sale, on event day, or when checking current performance. Use [Reporting](/core-platform/reporting/fundamentals) when you need exportable data, saved filter configurations, or scheduled distribution.
