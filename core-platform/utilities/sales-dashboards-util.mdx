## Overview

Sales dashboards provide a fast operational view of sales performance for selected entities (for example event schedules and event-level contexts where available).

## Where It Appears

- Event and schedule flows expose sales dashboard routes when enabled and permitted.
- Dashboard availability can depend on feature access and user permissions.

## What To Use It For

- Quick health check of current sales trends.
- Comparing related dates/events in a schedule.
- Identifying unusual drops/spikes before deeper report analysis.

## When To Use Reporting Instead

Use [Reporting](/core-platform/reporting/fundamentals) when you need:

- saved, repeatable filter logic
- scheduled distribution
- exports and publication workflows
