## Overview

API token management allows authorized users to create personal access tokens and revoke them when no longer needed.

## Core Flow

1. Open API Tokens.
2. Create token with a name.
3. Copy plaintext token at creation time.
4. Revoke token when access should end.

## Important Notes

- Plaintext token is shown only at creation.
- Users can only revoke tokens they own.
- Use descriptive naming so audit/revocation is easy.
