## Overview

API tokens allow third-party services and integrations to authenticate with the platform API on your behalf. Each token is a personal access credential tied to your user account — it carries your permissions and visibility groups, so API requests made with your token can access the same data you can.

Token management is available in both the admin panel (under **Settings > API Tokens**) and the partner hub.

## Creating a Token

1. Navigate to **Settings > API Tokens** (or **API Tokens** in the partner hub)
2. Click **Generate token**
3. Enter a **Name** for the token — this is an internal identifier to help you remember what the token is used for (e.g. "Production Integration", "Reporting Script")
4. Click **Generate token** to create it

The new token is displayed in a preview modal immediately after creation.

<Warning>
The full token is only shown once, at the moment of creation. Copy it immediately and store it securely. If you lose the token, you cannot retrieve it — you will need to generate a new one.
</Warning>

The preview modal includes a **Copy** button for easy clipboard access.

## How Tokens Work

Tokens authenticate API requests using the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer {your-token}
```

For programmatic authentication, use the [Retrieve API Token](/api-reference/authentication/retrieve-api-token) endpoint to obtain a token, and the [Retrieve Authenticated User](/api-reference/authentication/retrieve-authenticated-user) endpoint to verify your identity.

Each token inherits the permissions and visibility groups of the user who created it. This means:
- The token can access the same data you can see in the admin panel
- The token is subject to the same permission restrictions as your account
- If your permissions change, the token's access changes accordingly

<Note>
If you need to restrict API access to a subset of data or specific endpoints, create a separate user account with limited roles and generate a token for that user instead. This is recommended for production integrations where you want to follow the principle of least privilege.
</Note>

## Managing Tokens

The token management page lists all your tokens with:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | The identifier you provided when creating the token |
| **Token** | A partially masked version of the token (ID only, hash hidden) |
| **Created** | When the token was created |
| **Last used** | When the token was last used for an API request (e.g. "5 days ago" or "never") |

### Filtering Tokens

Use the name filter to search for specific tokens by their identifier. Tokens are listed with the most recently created first.

### Revoking a Token

To revoke a token:

1. Find the token in the list
2. Click the **delete** action
3. Confirm the revocation

Revocation is immediate and permanent. Any integration using the revoked token will immediately lose API access and receive authentication errors.

<Note>
You can only manage tokens you created. You cannot view or revoke tokens belonging to other users.
</Note>

## When to Revoke Tokens

Revoke a token when:
- The integration it was created for is no longer in use
- You suspect the token may have been exposed or compromised
- You're rotating tokens as part of a security practice
- The integration's access requirements have changed and you need to issue a new token with different permissions (by creating it under a different user account)
