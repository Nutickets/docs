## Overview

Global search is an AJAX-powered cross-entity search endpoint used throughout admin experiences.

## Supported Entity Types

Examples include:

- events
- sale items / inventory items
- schedules
- orders / reservations
- customers
- event media
- listings and articles
- customer groups

## Search Behavior

- Entity-specific filters are applied (for example date ranges, company, status).
- Permission checks run before returning entity results.
- Response payloads include admin route hints for quick navigation.

## Operational Tips

- Use filters instead of broad text when searching large datasets.
- For events and orders, add date/status constraints to reduce noise.
