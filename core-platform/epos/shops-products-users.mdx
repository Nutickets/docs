## Overview

Shops are the organisational units of EPOS — each shop represents a physical selling location such as a bar, food stall, or merchandise stand. Within each shop, you create products (the items for sale), assign staff (the users who operate the shop via the EPOS Pro app), and track sales performance.

This page covers the full lifecycle of managing shops and products from the admin panel.

## Creating a Shop

To create a new shop:

1. Navigate to **EPOS > EPOS Shops**
2. Click **Add new shop**
3. Enter a **Shop name**
4. Configure the shop settings described below
5. Assign staff users to the shop
6. Click **Save**

### Shop Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Shop name** | The name displayed in the admin panel and EPOS Pro app. Supports multiple languages if your account has localisation enabled. |
| **Send customer purchase emails** | When enabled, customers receive an email confirmation after each purchase at this shop |
| **Send staff purchase emails** | When enabled, staff users assigned to this shop receive email notifications when purchases are made |
| **Hidden** | When enabled, the shop does not appear in the EPOS Pro app and is hidden from the admin shop list by default. Useful for deactivating a shop without deleting it. |

<Note>
A shop can only be deleted if it has no recorded sales. If you need to take a shop out of use but it already has sales history, toggle **Hidden** on instead. The admin shop list includes a filter to show or hide hidden shops.
</Note>

### Internal Questions

Shops support internal questions — custom data fields filled out by organisers during shop setup. These are configured separately and appear on the shop creation form when available. Responses are included in EPOS reports.

## Assigning Users to a Shop

Every shop needs at least one assigned user. Only assigned users (and super users) can access the shop in the EPOS Pro app and manage its products in the admin panel.

To assign users when creating or editing a shop:

1. In the **Shop users** section, select the users you want to assign
2. Click **Save**

To manage users from the shop dashboard:

1. Navigate to the shop's dashboard
2. Click **Manage users**
3. Select or deselect users in the modal
4. Click **Save**

<Note>
If you need to assign a user who doesn't have an account yet, click **Create new user** from the shop form or the user management modal. After creating the user, you'll be returned to the shop form with the new user automatically selected.
</Note>

### User Access Rules

| User Type | Access |
|-----------|--------|
| **Assigned users** | Can view and manage the shop and its products, and operate the shop in the EPOS Pro app |
| **Super users** | Can access all shops regardless of assignment |
| **Unassigned users** | Cannot see or interact with the shop |

When a non-super user creates a shop, they are automatically assigned to it.

## Shop Dashboard

Each shop has a dashboard that provides an overview of sales performance and quick access to product and user management.

### Sales Statistics

The dashboard displays four statistics that can be filtered by date range and currency:

| Statistic | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Total sales** | The total revenue generated by this shop |
| **Total orders** | The number of completed orders |
| **Average spend per customer** | The mean spend across unique customers |
| **Average spend per customer order** | The mean order value across all orders |

### Managing Products from the Dashboard

The dashboard lists all products in the shop with the following visible at a glance:

- Product image, name, and categories
- Stock capacity (how many sold vs total stock)
- Sale status (on sale, off sale, or sold out)
- Price per currency

From here you can:

- **Search** products by name
- **Filter** to show or hide deleted products
- **Add an existing product** from another shop using the **Add product** button
- **Create a new product** directly from the modal

### Managing Users from the Dashboard

The dashboard also shows all users assigned to the shop. You can search users by name and use the **Manage users** button to add or remove assignments.

## Creating a Product

Products are created within a specific shop. To create a new product:

1. Navigate to the shop's dashboard
2. Click **Create new product** (or use **Add product** to select an existing one)
3. Fill in the product details described below
4. Click **Save**

### Basic Details

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | The product name displayed in the EPOS Pro app and reports. Supports multiple languages. |
| **Description** | An optional description of the product. |
| **Categories** | Assign the product to one or more categories. Categories help staff find products quickly in the app. |

### Pricing

Product pricing is set per currency. If your EPOS is configured with a standard currency (e.g. GBP), you set prices in that currency with optional tax band assignment. If you're using a [custom currency](/core-platform/epos/custom-currencies) (e.g. tokens), processing fees are hidden since transactions aren't in real money.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Price** | The selling price in the EPOS currency |
| **Tax band** | The tax rate applied to the product (available for standard currencies) |
| **Custom price** | When enabled, staff can enter a custom price at the point of sale instead of using the fixed price |

### Stock

By default, EPOS products have unlimited stock. If you need to limit availability:

1. Disable the unlimited stock toggle
2. Enter the **total stock** quantity

The shop dashboard shows a capacity bar for each product indicating how many units have been sold against the total stock. When stock reaches zero, the product shows as **sold out**.

### Sale Dates

Control when a product is available for purchase:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **On sale from** | The date and time the product becomes available. Leave empty to make it available immediately. |
| **On sale until** | The date and time the product stops being available. Leave empty for no end date. |

### Display Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Hide when off sale** | When enabled, the product is hidden from the EPOS Pro app when it's outside its sale dates rather than showing as unavailable |
| **Hide when out of stock** | When enabled, the product is hidden from the app when its stock reaches zero rather than showing as sold out |

### Internal Questions

Products can also have internal questions — custom data fields that organisers fill in when creating or editing the product. These are separate from the shop-level internal questions and appear when configured for EPOS products.

## Assigning Existing Products

Rather than creating a product from scratch, you can assign an existing EPOS product to a shop. This is useful when multiple shops sell the same item.

1. Navigate to the shop's dashboard
2. Click **Add product**
3. Select from the list of available EPOS products
4. Click to assign

<Note>
When you assign an existing product to a shop, the product appears in both shops. Changes to the product (name, price, etc.) from either shop can optionally update the product across all shops where it's assigned, using the mass update feature during editing.
</Note>

## Editing Products

When editing a product that exists in multiple shops, the system detects related copies and offers to apply your changes across all of them. You can choose which fields to update in bulk and which to leave unchanged on the other copies.

If there are many related products to update, the changes are processed in the background via a queue rather than applied immediately.

## Deleting and Restoring

### Shops

- Click **Delete Shop** from the shop preferences tab
- A shop **cannot be deleted** if it has any recorded sales — the system displays: *"You cannot delete a shop that has sales."*
- Deleted shops can be restored from the shop list using the trashed filter

### Products

- Click the delete button on the product list item in the shop dashboard
- A product **cannot be deleted** if it has any recorded sales — the system displays: *"You cannot delete an epos product that has sales."*
- Deleted products can be restored from the shop dashboard using the trashed filter

<Note>
Deleting a shop or product is a soft delete — the record is archived and can be restored. If you want to hide a shop without deleting it, use the **Hidden** toggle in shop settings instead.
</Note>

## Data Import

Shops and products can be created in bulk using the data import feature.

### Importing Shops

The shop import supports the following fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **name** | Yes | The shop name |
| **external_id** | No | An optional external identifier (must be unique per company) |
| **send_customer_purchase_emails** | No | Whether to email customers on purchase |
| **send_staff_purchase_emails** | No | Whether to email staff on purchase |
| **users** | No | Comma-delimited email addresses of users to assign |

Internal question fields can also be included if configured.

### Importing Products

The product import supports the following fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Shop reference** | Yes | One of: `shop_name`, `shop_id`, or `shop_external_id` to identify the target shop |
| **name** | Yes | The product name |
| **categories** | No | Product categories |
| **pricing** | No | Product pricing (supports EPOS currency) |

Standard sale item fields (description, stock, sale dates, etc.) and internal question fields are also supported.
