## Overview

- Access Control Pro is the primary mobile workflow for event entry scanning.
- App users scan order item barcodes/QRs against a selected event zone.
- Scan outcomes follow zone rules (mode, capacity, limits) and item validity.

## Typical Operator Flow

1. Sign in to the app with an authorized user.
2. Select the event and zone.
3. Scan customer codes.
4. Review allowed/denied feedback and reason messaging.

## Validation Inputs

The scan response considers:

- Zone eligibility (item allowed in zone)
- Scan limit and prior scan history
- Sale item validity dates (unless overridden)
- Zone capacity and scan mode

## Secure Scanning

If secure barcode features are enabled, scan metadata includes secure context and device UUID telemetry in stored scan records.
