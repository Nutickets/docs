title: "Standard Entry"
description: "How standard zone-based entry works for scanned tickets, products, guest lists, and season tickets."
---

## Overview

- Access control manages how attendees are admitted to an event using barcode or NFC scanning.
- Standard entry is managed with **zones** on an event. A zone defines which sale items can be scanned, how scans are interpreted, and whether entry is limited.
- Scanning writes `in` / `out` records against order items, and attendance is calculated from the latest scan state.
- Entry behaviour depends on both zone settings and sale item validity settings.
- Scanning is performed via the [Access Control Pro](/mobile-apps/access-control-pro) mobile app, the [Box Office Pro](/mobile-apps/box-office-pro) app, or [through the admin panel](/core-platform/access-control/admitting-via-admin).

## Scanning Mode (Event-Level)

The scanning mode is an event-level setting that controls how the [Access Control Pro](/mobile-apps/access-control-pro) app reads tickets. It is configured from the event dashboard.

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **QR Only** | Scans standard QR codes and barcodes printed on tickets or displayed in the customer's account. |
| **Secure QR Only** | Scans time-based dynamic QR codes that rotate periodically, preventing screenshot sharing. See [secure barcodes](/core-platform/advanced/secure-barcodes). |
| **NFC** | Pairs NFC tags to tickets for tap-based entry. See [NFC pairing](/core-platform/advanced/nfc-pairing). |

<Note>
The scanning mode affects the mobile app only. Admin-based admission and box office admission are not affected by this setting.
</Note>

## Entry Flow

1. Create one or more [zones](/core-platform/access-control/zones) on the event.
2. Choose which sale items can enter each zone (or allow all eligible items).
3. Configure scan mode and limits.
4. Admit customers from [Access Control Pro](/core-platform/access-control/admitting-via-app), [mobile box office](/core-platform/access-control/admitting-via-mbo), or [admin tools](/core-platform/access-control/admitting-via-admin).

## Scan Modes (Zone-Level)

Each zone has its own scanning mode that controls how entry and exit are tracked.

| Mode | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| **In Only** | Attendees are scanned in. No exit scanning. Suitable for general entry gates where you only need to know who has arrived. |
| **In/Out Manual** | The operator selects whether they are scanning an attendee in or out. Tracks current occupancy and visit duration. |
| **In/Out Automatic** | The system automatically determines whether to scan in or out based on the attendee's current status. Tracks current occupancy and visit duration. |

<Note>
When using In/Out Automatic mode, rapid scanning is enabled automatically to avoid confusion during the automatic in/out decision.
</Note>

## Scan Limits

| Setting | Behaviour |
|---------|-----------|
| **Unlimited access** | Attendees can enter the zone as many times as they like. |
| **Single access** | Each ticket can only be scanned in once. Subsequent entry attempts are rejected. |

## What Can Be Scanned

Zones can target event sale items that support attendance workflows, including tickets, products, guest lists, and season tickets.

<Note>
Use [validity dates](/core-platform/access-control/validity-dates) on sale items to define when a barcode is valid for entry.
