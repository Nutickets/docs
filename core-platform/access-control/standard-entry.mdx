description: "How standard zone-based entry works for scanned tickets, products, guest lists, and season tickets."

## Overview

- Standard entry is managed with **zones** on an event.
- A zone defines which sale items can be scanned, how scans are interpreted, and whether entry is limited.
- Scanning writes `in` / `out` records against order items, and attendance is calculated from the latest scan state.
- Entry behaviour depends on both zone settings and sale item validity settings.

## Entry Flow

1. Create one or more [zones](/core-platform/access-control/zones) on the event.
2. Choose which sale items can enter each zone (or allow all eligible items).
3. Configure scan mode and limits.
4. Admit customers from [Access Control Pro](/core-platform/access-control/admitting-via-app), [mobile box office](/core-platform/access-control/admitting-via-mbo), or [admin tools](/core-platform/access-control/admitting-via-admin).

## Scan Modes

| Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| In only | Records entry scans only. Current attendance cannot be decremented by scan-out. |
| In/Out manual | Supports both directions, selected by the operator at scan time. |
| In/Out automatic | Alternates by current state (scan in, then scan out). |

## Scan Limits

| Setting | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Unlimited access | The same item can be admitted multiple times. |
| Single access | The item can only be admitted once for that zone. |

## What Can Be Scanned

Zones can target event sale items that support attendance workflows, including tickets, products, guest lists, and season tickets.

<Note>
Use [validity dates](/core-platform/access-control/validity-dates) on sale items to define when a barcode is valid for entry.
