description: "Admit attendees from mobile box office tooling and related APIs."

## Overview

- Mobile box office workflows can perform scan-based admission for supported events.
- Admission logic is shared with standard zone scanning rules.
- This is useful where sales and entry are handled by the same mobile operations team.

## How It Differs From Access Control Pro

| Area | MBO behaviour |
|---|---|
| Primary use | Combined sales + admission operations |
| Feature surface | Depends on box office/mobile feature access for the company |
| Rule engine | Reuses zone + validity checks used across the platform |

## Operational Notes

- Keep zone configuration clear and minimal for mobile crews.
- Validate sales-channel and visibility settings so MBO operators can find intended sale items quickly.
- Use [single-access limits](/core-platform/access-control/standard-entry) where repeat entry must be blocked.
