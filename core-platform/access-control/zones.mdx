## Overview

- A zone is an access boundary inside an event.
- Zones can be configured per event with independent scanning and entry rules.
- The zone list includes attendance stats, historical peaks, and zone-level reports.

## Core Configuration

| Area | What it controls |
|---|---|
| Basic details | Zone name and optional opening/closing date window |
| Eligible items | All tickets/items or a selected set of sale items |
| Scanning settings | Scan mode, scan accuracy mode, scan limit, capacity |
| Advanced settings | Age restrictions, auto-scan-out schedule, validity bypass, attendee visibility |

## Scanning Accuracy

| Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Precision scanning | Full validation for each scan result. |
| Rapid scanning | Optimised for fast throughput in queue-heavy scenarios. |

## Capacity Behaviour

- Zone capacity is meaningful for in/out capable modes.
- In-only zones do not track real-time occupancy decrement.

## Auto Scan-Out

Zones can hold a schedule of auto scan-out timestamps. This is useful for timed clear-down rules where operators do not manually scan customers out.

## Permissions

Zone management requires event edit access plus zone permissions (view/create/edit/delete depending on action).
