## Overview

- Zones represent distinct areas within your event where attendees are scanned in or out.
- Every event has at least one zone — the default **Entry** zone — and additional zones can be created for separate areas such as VIP sections, stages, or product collection points.
- Zones are managed from the **Zones** tab on the event dashboard.

## Zone Configuration

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | The zone name, displayed in the scanning app and reports. |
| **Scanning mode** | Controls how scans are recorded for this zone. See [scan modes](/core-platform/access-control/standard-entry#scan-modes-zone-level). |
| **Scanning limit** | Controls whether attendees can re-enter the zone. See [scan limits](/core-platform/access-control/standard-entry#scan-limits). |
| **Scanning accuracy** | **Precision scanning** shows a confirmation screen when a scan matches multiple eligible items (e.g. a ticket with add-ons). **Rapid scanning** selects the first eligible item automatically for faster throughput. |
| **Capacity** | Maximum number of attendees allowed in the zone at any time. Leave blank for unlimited. Only tracked when using an in/out scanning mode. |
| **Opening date** | Optionally restrict scanning to after a specific date and time. |
| **Closing date** | Optionally restrict scanning to before a specific date and time. |

## Eligible Items

By default, all barcoded items (tickets, products, etc.) for the event can be used to access every zone. You can restrict a zone to specific sale items by disabling **Allow all tickets** and selecting the items that should be permitted.

## Age Restrictions

Zones can optionally enforce minimum and/or maximum age limits. This requires the date of birth [data capture](/core-platform/data-capture/introduction) field to be enabled. When an attendee's date of birth is not available, it is at the operator's discretion whether to admit them.

## Auto Scan-Out

For zones using an in/out scanning mode, you can configure **auto scan-out times** — scheduled times at which all attendees currently in the zone are automatically scanned out. This is useful for clearing a zone at the end of a session, shift, or event day.

Entering a past time will immediately scan out all current attendees.

## Advanced Zone Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Ignore validity dates** | When enabled, the zone does not check the sale item's validity dates when admitting attendees. Useful for zones that should accept any valid ticket regardless of time restrictions. |
| **Hide attendees** | Hides the attendee list from the zone view in the [Access Control Pro](/mobile-apps/access-control-pro) app. |

## Zone Statistics

The zones listing on the event dashboard displays real-time statistics for each zone:

- **Attendance** — Number of unique attendees scanned in (and current occupancy for in/out zones).
- **Capacity** — Current occupancy relative to the zone's capacity limit.
- **Scan mode** — The zone's scanning mode (in only, in/out).
- **Scan limit** — Whether access is unlimited or single-entry.
- **Age restrictions** — Minimum and/or maximum age, if configured.

### Reports

Three reports are available from the zones listing:

- **Scanning Report** — Detailed log of all scans across zones.
- **Zone Summary Report** — Aggregated statistics per zone.
- **Customer Journey Report** — Tracks each attendee's movement across zones.

## Data Capture

Custom [data capture](/core-platform/data-capture/introduction) fields can be configured for access control. When enabled, these fields are presented to operators in the scanning app, allowing information to be collected at the point of admission.

## Permissions

Zone management requires event edit access plus zone permissions (view/create/edit/delete depending on action).
