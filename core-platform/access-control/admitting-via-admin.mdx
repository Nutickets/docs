title: "Admitting Via Admin"
description: "Run entry operations from admin tooling, including supervised and bulk scan workflows."
---

## Overview

- Admin users can perform zone scanning from event access-control interfaces.
- This mode is commonly used for troubleshooting, supervised entry, or operational back-office support.
- Bulk scan workflows are transaction-safe: denied items can roll back the batch to avoid partial admissions.

## Admin Scan Behaviour

- Admin scan actions evaluate recognized barcodes against the selected event zone.
- If no barcode matches are found, the request is rejected.
- If a denial occurs in bulk scan, prior scans in that transaction are reverted.

## Permissions

Admin admitting requires either:

- permission to edit the event, or
- permission to edit the specific zone.

## When To Use

- Resolve edge-case admissions at control points.
- Correct manual-entry scenarios during assisted support.
- Supervise admissions when mobile operators escalate an issue.
