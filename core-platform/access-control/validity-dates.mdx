title: "Validity Dates"
description: "Configure when sale items are valid for scanning and admission."
---

## Overview

- Validity dates control when an item can be successfully scanned for entry.
- Validity is configured on scan-capable sale items.
- Zone-level settings can optionally ignore validity checks for specific operational workflows.

## Check-In Time Presets

Sale items support these validity patterns:

| Preset | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Anytime | No bounded validity window is enforced for event-time scanning. |
| One hour before event start until event end | Auto-sets a practical event window. |
| Custom | Uses manually selected `valid_from` and `valid_until` values. |
| Timeslot-based | For timeslotted items, validity follows the assigned timeslot window. |

## Additional Controls

- **Show check-in times in shop**: exposes validity timings to customers.
- **Scanning grace period**: extends tolerance around configured validity times.

<Note>
Timeslotted sale items inherit the timeslot timing model. This reduces drift between entry logic and displayed slot times.
</Note>

## Zone Interaction

Zone settings can override validity checks when needed:

- `ignore_validity_dates` at zone level
- forced ignores in specific admin bulk-scan workflows

Use overrides only for supervised exception handling.
