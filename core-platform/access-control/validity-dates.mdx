title: "Validity Dates"
description: "Configure when sale items are valid for scanning and admission."

## Overview

- Validity dates control the time window during which a ticket is valid for entry.
- They are configured per [sale item](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts) and determine when the [Access Control Pro](/mobile-apps/access-control-pro) app will accept a scan.
- Zone-level settings can optionally ignore validity checks for specific operational workflows.

## Check-in Time Options

When configuring a sale item's scanning settings, you can choose how the validity window is determined:

| Option | Behaviour |
|--------|-----------|
| **Anytime** | The ticket can be scanned at any time — no time-based restrictions apply. |
| **Hour before event** | Valid from one hour before the event start time until the event end time. |
| **Custom** | Set specific valid-from and valid-until dates and times. |
| **Timeslot-based** | Valid during the [timeslot](/core-platform/event-management/timeslots) the ticket belongs to (only available for timeslotted items). |

<Note>
Timeslotted sale items inherit the timeslot timing model. This reduces drift between entry logic and displayed slot times.
</Note>

## Scanning Grace Period

A grace period (in minutes) can be set on each sale item to extend the validity window in both directions. For example, a 15-minute grace period allows scanning 15 minutes before the valid-from time and 15 minutes after the valid-until time.

<Note>
The grace period only applies when scanning into zones that have validity date checks enabled (i.e. where **Ignore validity dates** is not turned on).
</Note>

## Displaying Validity in the Shop

You can optionally display check-in times to customers in their account, order confirmation, and on ticket media by enabling **Show check-in times in shop** on the sale item.

## Zone Interaction

Zone settings can override validity checks when needed:

- **Ignore validity dates** at zone level — the zone does not check the sale item's validity dates when admitting attendees.
- Forced ignores in specific admin bulk-scan workflows.

Use overrides only for supervised exception handling.
