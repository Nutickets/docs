## Overview

Forms let you create standalone data capture pages on your ticket shop — contact forms, enquiry forms, registration forms, or any custom form you need. Each form gets its own URL, collects responses through your existing [data capture](/core-platform/data-capture/introduction) questions, and can route submissions to email recipients and external services.

Forms are managed from **Data Capture > Forms** in admin.

<Note>
The form builder must be enabled for your company before the forms section appears in admin.
</Note>

## Creating a Form

1. Navigate to **Data Capture > Forms**
2. Click **Add new form**
3. Configure the form:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | The form's title, displayed to visitors at the top of the form page |
| **Description** | Optional introductory text shown above the form fields |
| **Success message** | The message displayed after a visitor submits the form. If not set, a default confirmation message is shown |
| **Success URL** | Optional — redirect visitors to this URL after submission instead of showing the success message |
| **Recipients** | Email addresses that receive a notification when the form is submitted (enter multiple addresses separated by commas) |
| **API integration** | Optional — connect the form to an external service like Mailchimp or Salesmate |

4. Click **Save**

## Adding Questions

Forms collect data through **data capture questions** — the same question system used across the platform for events, customers, and payments. After creating a form, add questions to define what fields visitors see.

1. Open the form from **Data Capture > Forms**
2. Click **Add questions to form**
3. Select questions from your data capture library
4. Configure each question's settings for this form
5. Drag questions to reorder them

Questions support various field types — text, email, phone, dropdowns, checkboxes, and more. See [Data Capture](/core-platform/data-capture/introduction) for details on creating and configuring questions.

<Note>
The order you arrange questions in determines the order they appear to visitors on the form page.
</Note>

## API Integrations

Forms can send submission data to external services automatically. When a visitor submits the form, the data is forwarded to the configured integration.

### Supported Integrations

| Integration | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Mailchimp** | Add form respondents to a Mailchimp audience list |
| **Salesmate** | Create contacts or leads in Salesmate CRM |

### Configuring an Integration

When you select an integration, additional configuration fields appear. Each integration has **default fields** that must be configured (like API credentials and list identifiers) and supports **custom field mapping** to connect form questions to fields in the external service.

For each mapped field, choose the **data source**:

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Fixed** | A static value you enter — the same value is sent for every submission |
| **Data capture** | The value comes from one of the form's questions — each submission sends the visitor's answer |

<Accordion title="Mailchimp configuration">
Mailchimp integration requires:
- **List ID** — the Mailchimp audience list to add contacts to
- **Server prefix** — your Mailchimp data centre prefix (e.g. `us1`)
- **API key** — your Mailchimp API key
- **Email field** — which form question captures the email address

Additional custom fields can map form questions to Mailchimp merge tags.
</Accordion>

## Previewing a Form

Preview how the form appears to visitors before sharing it. From the form's detail page, click the preview action to open a signed preview URL showing the live form.

## Embedding a Form

Forms can be embedded on external websites using a **tracking script**. From the form's detail page, click **Form tracking script** to view the embed code. Copy this script and add it to any external page where you want the form to appear.

## Viewing Responses

Track form submissions from the form's detail page:

- The **response count** shows how many unique submissions the form has received
- Click **View report** to open the full response report, which lists all submissions with their question answers

Responses are counted by unique submission identifier — a single visitor submitting the form once counts as one response.

## Form SEO

Each form supports SEO metadata:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Meta title** | The title shown in search engine results and browser tabs |
| **Meta description** | The summary shown in search engine results |
| **Meta image** | The image displayed when the form page is shared on social media |

## Webhooks

Form submissions automatically trigger webhooks, sending the submission data to any configured webhook endpoints. The webhook payload includes:

- Company information
- Form details (ID and name)
- All question answers
- Customer information (if the visitor is logged in)
- Submission timestamp

See [Webhooks](/core-platform/technical/webhooks) for details on configuring webhook endpoints.

## Deleting and Restoring Forms

Deleting a form moves it to the trash and removes its public page. Deleted forms can be restored from the trash to bring them back.
