## Overview

Articles let you publish content alongside your events — news updates, guides, venue information, artist profiles, or anything else your audience needs. Each article has its own page with a dedicated URL, and articles are surfaced to visitors through [article blocks](/core-platform/cms/blocks#article-blocks) on your [CMS pages](/core-platform/cms/pages).

Articles are organised into **article types** (categories), can be tagged for filtering and discovery, and support rich content through a flexible content block system.

Articles are managed from **CMS > Articles** in admin.

<Note>
Articles must be enabled for your company before the articles section appears in admin.

## Article Types

Before creating articles, set up at least one **article type**. Article types act as categories that group related articles and give each group its own URL prefix and listing page.

For example, you might create article types like **News**, **Guides**, or **Artist Profiles**. Each article type gets its own URL structure — an article in the "News" type with the URL `summer-announcement` would be accessible at `/news/summer-announcement`.

### Creating an Article Type

1. Navigate to **CMS > Article types**
2. Click **Create**
3. Enter a **Name** for the type
4. Set the **URL** — this becomes the URL prefix for all articles in this type
5. Optionally set **Meta title** and **Meta description** for the article type's listing page
6. Click **Save**

Article types can be hidden by toggling visibility. A hidden article type does not appear in navigation or listings but its articles remain accessible via direct URL.

## Creating an Article

1. Navigate to **CMS > Articles**
2. Click **Create**
3. Fill in the article details:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Article name** | The title displayed on the article page and in listings |
| **Article type** | Which category this article belongs to |
| **URL** | The article's URL slug — combined with the article type URL to form the full path |
| **Subheading** | A subtitle displayed below the article name |
| **Author** | The person credited as the article's author |
| **Article date** | The publication date shown to readers |
| **Article tags** | Tags used for filtering and for tag-based article blocks |

4. Click **Save**

<Note>
Each article must have a unique URL within its article type. If you try to use a URL that already exists in the same type, validation will prevent saving.
</Note>

## Content Blocks

Once an article is created, you build its content by adding **content blocks**. Each block is a section of the article page — you can mix different block types to create rich, varied layouts.

### Adding Content Blocks

1. Open the article from **CMS > Articles**
2. Navigate to the article's content area
3. Add content blocks in the order you want them to appear
4. Drag to reorder blocks as needed

### Content Block Types

| Block type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **HTML** | Rich text content created with the WYSIWYG editor — the most common block type for article body text |
| **Gallery** | An image gallery with multiple layout options |
| **Video** | An embedded video |
| **Article** | A section displaying related articles |
| **Social** | An embedded social media post |
| **Template** | Custom content defined by a JSON schema |
| **Author** | An author biography section |
| **Header** | A page section header |
| **Footer** | A page section footer |
| **Menu** | A navigation menu block |

### Content Block Settings

Each content block supports these settings:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Title** | An optional title displayed above the block's content |
| **Display in menu** | When enabled, the block appears as a navigable section in the article's sidebar menu |
| **Layout** | Controls the visual arrangement of the block's content |

### Content Block Layouts

Blocks that display multiple items (galleries, related articles) support these layout options:

| Layout | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Automatic** | System chooses the best layout based on content |
| **2-column** | Content arranged in two columns |
| **3-column** | Content arranged in three columns |
| **Carousel** | Content displayed in a scrollable carousel |
| **Collage** | Content arranged in a collage-style grid |
| **Full-width** | Content spans the full page width |
| **Banner** | Content displayed as a banner |

## Article Page Settings

Each article has page settings that control its appearance and metadata, separate from its content.

### Images

| Image | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Page header** | The banner image displayed at the top of the article page |
| **Card thumbnail** | The image shown when the article appears in listings and article blocks |
| **Meta image** | The image displayed when the article is shared on social media |

### SEO Metadata

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Meta title** | The title shown in search engine results (recommended: under 60 characters) |
| **Meta description** | The summary shown in search engine results (recommended: under 160 characters) |

### Article Content Width

Control how wide the article content area is on the page. Narrower widths improve readability for text-heavy articles, while wider settings suit image-heavy or multi-column layouts.

### Call to Action

Add a call-to-action element to the article to direct readers to a specific destination after reading.

## Publishing and Visibility

Articles have two visibility controls:

- **Article date** — articles are only visible to customers after their publication date has passed. Set a future date to schedule publication.
- **Hidden** — toggle an article as hidden to remove it from listings and article blocks. Hidden articles are still accessible via their direct URL.

### Draft and Published States

Articles without a publication date or with a future date are effectively in a draft state — they won't appear in any article blocks or listings. Once the publication date passes, the article becomes visible wherever it's referenced.

## Tags

Tags help organise articles and power tag-based article blocks. When you create an [article block](/core-platform/cms/blocks#article-blocks) with the **Articles with tags** source, the block automatically displays all articles matching those tags.

Tags are managed at the article level — add tags when creating or editing an article.

## Authors

Each article can be attributed to an author. The author name appears on the article page, and if you add an **Author** content block, it displays the author's biography and photo.

## Deleting and Restoring Articles

Deleting an article moves it to the trash. Deleted articles are removed from all article blocks and listings. You can restore a deleted article from the trash to bring it back.
