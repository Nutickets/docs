## Overview

Website text lets you customise the wording used throughout your ticket shop. Every label, button, message, and piece of copy in the shop comes from a default set of translations. With website text overrides, you can change any of these to match your brand voice, terminology, or specific event needs — without touching code.

Overrides can be applied **globally** (affecting every page in the shop) or **scoped** to a specific context so the change only appears in certain situations.

Website text is managed from the **Website text** section in admin.

## How Overrides Work

The shop displays text using translation keys — each piece of text has a key (like a label for "Add to basket" or "Sold out") and a default value. When you create a website text override, you replace the default value with your custom text for that key.

The original default value is always shown alongside your override for reference, so you can see what the text would normally say.

### What You Can Override

Any user-facing text in the shop can be overridden, including:

- Button labels (e.g. changing "Add to basket" to "Reserve now")
- Status messages and notifications
- Form field labels and help text
- Navigation text
- Error messages and validation text
- Email template text

### Multi-Language Support

If your shop supports multiple languages, you can set overrides for each language independently. When editing a text override, you'll see fields for each enabled language so you can customise the wording in every supported locale.

## Scoping Overrides

Overrides can be scoped to different contexts, allowing the same text key to show different values depending on the situation.

### Global Overrides

A global override applies company-wide — every page and every context in the shop will use the overridden text. This is the default scope.

**Use for:** Company-wide terminology changes, brand voice adjustments, or any wording change that should apply everywhere.

### Event-Specific Overrides

Scope an override to a single event so the custom text only appears when a customer is interacting with that event.

**Use for:** Event-specific terminology (e.g. changing "Tickets" to "Passes" for a particular event), event-specific messaging, or promotional wording for a single event.

### Schedule-Specific Overrides

Scope an override to an event schedule so the custom text appears for all events within that schedule.

**Use for:** Consistent terminology across a series of related events that share a schedule.

### Customer Group-Specific Overrides

Scope an override to a customer group so the custom text only appears for customers in that group.

**Use for:** Segment-specific messaging, VIP-specific wording, or different terminology for different customer audiences.

## Priority Resolution

When multiple overrides exist for the same text key, the most specific override takes priority:

1. **Event-specific** override (highest priority)
2. **Schedule-specific** override
3. **Customer group-specific** override
4. **Global** override
5. **Default translation** (lowest priority — used when no override exists)

If an event-specific override exists for a text key, it will be used instead of any global or schedule override for that same key when a customer is viewing that event.

<Note>
Event-specific text only displays when the customer's basket contains items from a **single event**. If the basket contains items from multiple events, event-specific overrides cannot be applied and the global override (or default) is used instead. For the same reason, if you rely on event-specific text, consider disabling the global basket so customers check out per-event.

## Editing Website Text

1. Navigate to the **Website text** section in admin
2. Optionally select a context (event, schedule, or customer group) to scope the overrides
3. Browse or search for the text you want to change
4. Enter your custom text in the override field — the original default is shown for reference
5. Save your changes

Changes take effect immediately in the shop.

To revert an override, clear the custom text field and save. The shop will return to using the default translation.
