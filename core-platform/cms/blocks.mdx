## Overview

- Blocks are reusable content/query units attached to listings.
- Multiple block types are supported and can be reordered per listing.
- Restoring/deleting block usage is handled across linked listing-block records.

## Block Types

| Type | Typical use |
|---|---|
| Event block | Display event collections |
| Article block | Display article content/lists |
| Template block | Reusable templated content structures |
| Listing block | The link record joining a block to a listing |

## Operational Notes

- Reordering is persisted explicitly.
- Block deletion from a listing can affect all linked listing-block records for that block instance.
