## Overview

Blocks are the building units of [CMS pages](/core-platform/cms/pages). Each block is a self-contained content module with its own layout, content source, and visual styling. You add blocks to pages to create rich, dynamic landing pages — and because blocks are reusable, a single block can appear on multiple pages.

There are three block types:

- **Event blocks** — pull in events and display them in grids, lists, sliders, maps, or calendars
- **Article blocks** — pull in [articles](/core-platform/cms/articles) and display them in lists, grids, or sliders
- **Template blocks** — display custom-designed content defined with a JSON schema

Blocks are created through a guided wizard when you add one to a page. You can also manage all blocks from their dedicated sections in admin.

## Event Blocks

Event blocks display collections of events on your pages. They are the most versatile block type, with multiple layout and content source options.

### Creating an Event Block

The event block wizard guides you through four steps:

1. **Block style** — choose a layout
2. **Select events** — choose how events are sourced
3. **Block details** — set the block name, event limit, ordering, and assign to pages
4. **Confirm** — review and save

### Layouts

| Layout | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Standard List** | Events displayed as a vertical list |
| **Featured Style** | A prominent featured layout with highlighted events |
| **Two-column Layout** | Events arranged in a two-column grid |
| **Three-column Layout** | Events arranged in a three-column grid |
| **Grouped Layout** | Events grouped by a shared attribute (city, tag, venue, or company) |
| **Slider Layout** | Events displayed in a horizontal carousel that visitors can scroll through |
| **Interactive Map** | Events plotted on an interactive map based on their venue locations |
| **Calendar** | Events displayed in a calendar view |

### Event Sources

Choose how the block finds its events:

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Handpicked events** | Manually select specific events to display — you control the exact lineup |
| **Events with tags** | Automatically display events that match selected tags — the block updates as tagged events change |
| **Recently added events** | Automatically display the most recently created events |
| **Recently viewed events** | Display events the current visitor has recently viewed (personalised per customer) |
| **Recently liked events** | Display events the current visitor has liked (personalised per customer) |

### Ordering

Control the order events appear within the block:

| Order | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Order by start date** | Earliest upcoming events first |
| **Order by event ordering** | Uses the manual event sort order |
| **Order by tag ordering** | Orders events by their tag sort position |
| **Order by liked date** | Most recently liked first (for recently liked source) |
| **Order by viewed date** | Most recently viewed first (for recently viewed source) |

### Grouping

When using the **Grouped Layout**, events are organised under group headings. Choose a grouping attribute:

| Group by | Result |
|----------|--------|
| **City** | Events grouped by their venue's city |
| **Tag** | Events grouped by tag |
| **Venue** | Events grouped by venue |
| **Company** | Events grouped by company (useful for multi-company setups) |

You can also enable **Group by event schedule** to group events that belong to the same schedule together, regardless of the primary grouping.

### Event Limit

Most layouts support setting an **event limit** to cap how many events are shown. The **Calendar** layout does not use an event limit — it shows all matching events within the visible date range.

### Additional Options

- **Show past events** — include events that have already occurred
- **Show pagination** — display pagination controls when the number of events exceeds the limit

## Article Blocks

Article blocks display collections of [articles](/core-platform/cms/articles) on your pages. They work similarly to event blocks but are tailored for article content.

### Creating an Article Block

The article block wizard guides you through four steps:

1. **Block style** — choose a layout
2. **Select articles** — choose how articles are sourced
3. **Block details** — set the block name, article limit, ordering, and assign to pages
4. **Confirm** — review and save

### Layouts

| Layout | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Standard List** | Articles displayed as a vertical list |
| **Featured Style** | A prominent featured layout with highlighted articles |
| **Two-column Layout** | Articles arranged in a two-column grid |
| **Three-column Layout** | Articles arranged in a three-column grid |
| **Mixed grid Layout** | Articles displayed in a mixed-size grid combining large and small cards |
| **Slider Layout** | Articles displayed in a horizontal carousel |

### Article Sources

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Handpicked articles** | Manually select specific articles to display |
| **Articles with tags** | Automatically display articles that match selected tags |
| **Recently published articles** | Automatically display the most recently published articles |

### Ordering

| Order | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Order by publish date** | Most recently published articles first |
| **Order by tag ordering** | Orders articles by their tag sort position |

### Article Limit and Pagination

Set an **article limit** to cap how many articles are shown, and toggle **Show pagination** to add pagination controls.

## Template Blocks

Template blocks display custom-designed content using a JSON schema. They are the most flexible block type — rather than pulling in events or articles, they render whatever structure and content you define in the schema.

Template blocks are ideal for:
- Hero banners with custom layouts
- Promotional sections with specific styling
- Any bespoke content that doesn't fit the event or article block formats

### Creating a Template Block

Template blocks use a single-step wizard:

1. Enter a **Name** for the block
2. Define the **Schema** — the JSON structure that controls the block's content and layout
3. Assign the block to one or more **Pages**
4. Save

<Note>
Template blocks must be enabled for your company before they appear as an option. When enabled, you can add pre-designed templated blocks to event pages, article pages, and CMS pages.
</Note>

## Block Styling

Event and article blocks support visual customisation through preset themes and individual style settings. These control how event and article cards appear within the block.

### Presets

Choose from preset themes to quickly style a block:

| Preset | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Default** | Standard card appearance |
| **Background** | Cards with a background fill |
| **Simple** | Minimal, clean card styling |
| **Transparent** | Cards with no background |
| **Colour** | Cards using the brand colour scheme |
| **Bold** | High-contrast, visually prominent cards |

### Customisable Properties

Beyond presets, you can fine-tune individual styling options including:

- **Edge shape** — from sharp corners to fully rounded (pill)
- **Shadow** — from no shadow to extra large
- **Font sizes and weights** — for event/article name, date, venue, and price
- **Tag display** — show or hide tags, control their position and styling
- **Like button** — show or hide, choose icon and position
- **Date badge** — show or hide, control position
- **Hover effects** — visual feedback when visitors hover over cards
- **Padding and spacing** — control the internal spacing of cards
- **Animations** — enable scroll-triggered entrance animations for cards as they come into view

## Managing Blocks

Blocks can be managed from two places:

- **From a page** — add, reorder, or remove blocks directly on the page
- **From the block type's admin section** — manage all event blocks, article blocks, or template blocks across your site

### Reordering

Drag and drop blocks on a page to change their display order. The order is saved automatically.

### Removing vs Deleting

- **Removing** a block from a page breaks the association but keeps the block available for other pages
- **Deleting** a block removes it entirely — it will be removed from all pages it appears on

Deleted blocks can be restored from the trash.
