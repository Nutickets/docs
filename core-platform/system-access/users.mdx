## Overview

User management controls who can access admin tools and what they can do. Access is shaped by roles, abilities, and visibility groups.

## User Lifecycle

1. Create user and assign initial roles.
2. Optionally assign visibility groups and event assignments.
3. Optionally assign seating holds and shop access.
4. Update profile/security settings as needed.
5. Suspend/restore company membership when required.

## Key Controls

| Control | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Roles** | Defines broad permission sets. |
| **Direct abilities** | Fine-grained capability overrides. |
| **Visibility groups** | Restricts which records the user can see. |
| **Event assignments** | Narrows operational scope where configured. |
| **Two-factor state** | Indicates whether MFA is enabled for the user. |

## Suspension vs Deletion

Users are typically suspended from a company rather than hard-deleted, preserving audit and operational history.

## Access/Impersonation

Authorized admins can generate secure access/impersonation flows for troubleshooting or support workflows.
