description: "Use visibility groups to constrain record visibility for users while preserving operational permissions."

## Overview

Visibility groups control **what users can see**, separate from what they are allowed to do. They are used across entities such as events, venues, listings, and users.

## Core Behavior

- A user may belong to one or more visibility groups.
- Entity records can be associated with visibility groups.
- Queries using visibility-aware scopes only return records within the user’s permitted groups.

## Management Rules

- Visibility groups are company-scoped.
- Deletion is blocked if it would orphan users with no remaining visibility group.
- Users cannot delete a visibility group they currently belong to.

## Typical Use Cases

- Segregating teams by venue or region.
- Restricting promoters to their own events.
- Limiting operational teams to specific business units.
