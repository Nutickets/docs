## Overview

Authorization uses permission constants and scoped roles. Roles are assigned to users; permission checks resolve through those roles and optional direct abilities.

## Scoping Rules

- Admin role checks are company-scoped.
- Hub role checks are reseller/hub-scoped.
- Roles can be system/read-only in some contexts.

## Role Management

- Create custom roles with selected abilities.
- Edit role title/abilities (except read-only/system restrictions).
- Soft-delete/restore roles where supported.

## Permission Patterns

Common checks include:

- `view_any`
- `view`
- `create`
- `edit`
- `delete`
- domain-specific actions (publish, access, manage-fees, etc.)

`MANAGE` acts as broad shorthand for full entity control and should be used intentionally.

## Operational Guidance

- Prefer reusable role templates over many direct per-user abilities.
- Keep privileged roles (for example super-user style) tightly controlled.
- Review roles after major feature rollouts to avoid accidental overexposure.
