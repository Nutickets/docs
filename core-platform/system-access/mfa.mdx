## Overview

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second verification step when signing in. After entering their password, users must also provide a time-based code from an authenticator app on their phone. This protects accounts even if a password is compromised.

Two-factor authentication is voluntary — users enable it individually through their account settings. Once enabled, the additional verification step is required every time they sign in.

## Enabling Two-Factor Authentication

To enable two-factor authentication on your account:

1. Navigate to your account settings
2. Find the **Two-factor authentication** section
3. Click **Enable**

The setup process begins — you need to connect an authenticator app before two-factor authentication becomes active.

### Connecting Your Authenticator App

After clicking **Enable**, a QR code and secret key are displayed:

1. Open your authenticator app (such as Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password)
2. Scan the QR code displayed on screen, or manually enter the secret key shown below it
3. The app begins generating 6-digit codes that refresh every 30 seconds

<Note>
The QR code label shows your company or reseller name, making it easy to identify the account in your authenticator app.
</Note>

### Confirming Setup

To verify your authenticator app is connected correctly:

1. Enter the current 6-digit code from your authenticator app into the confirmation field
2. Click **Confirm setup**

Once confirmed, two-factor authentication is active on your account. You are shown a set of recovery codes — store these securely (see [Recovery Codes](#recovery-codes)).

<Note>
Until you confirm setup by entering a valid code, two-factor authentication is not active. If you navigate away before confirming, you will need to start the setup process again.
</Note>

## Signing In with Two-Factor Authentication

When two-factor authentication is enabled, the sign-in process has an additional step:

1. Enter your email and password as usual
2. You are redirected to the **Two-factor authentication** challenge page
3. Enter the current 6-digit code from your authenticator app
4. Click **Submit**

If you cannot access your authenticator app, you can switch to entering a recovery code instead (see [Using a Recovery Code to Sign In](#using-a-recovery-code-to-sign-in)).

## Recovery Codes

When you enable two-factor authentication, you receive **8 recovery codes**. These are single-use backup codes that let you sign in if you lose access to your authenticator app — for example, if your phone is lost, damaged, or reset.

### Storing Recovery Codes

After confirming your two-factor authentication setup, recovery codes are displayed. Store them in a secure location separate from your authenticator app, such as a password manager or printed copy kept in a safe place.

You can view your recovery codes at any time from the **Two-factor authentication** section of your account settings by clicking **Show recovery codes**.

### Using a Recovery Code to Sign In

If you cannot access your authenticator app during sign-in:

1. On the two-factor challenge screen, select the option to use a recovery code
2. Enter one of your unused recovery codes
3. Click **Submit**

Each recovery code can only be used once. After use, a replacement code is generated automatically, maintaining your total of 8 available codes.

### Regenerating Recovery Codes

If you suspect your recovery codes have been compromised or you have used several of them, you can generate a fresh set:

1. Navigate to your account settings
2. Find the **Two-factor authentication** section
3. Click **Regenerate recovery codes**

This replaces all existing recovery codes with 8 new ones. Any previously issued codes become invalid immediately.

<Warning>
After regenerating, store the new codes securely. The previous codes will no longer work.
</Warning>

## Disabling Two-Factor Authentication

To remove two-factor authentication from your account:

1. Navigate to your account settings
2. Find the **Two-factor authentication** section
3. Click **Disable**

Two-factor authentication is removed immediately. You will no longer be prompted for a code when signing in.

## Monitoring Two-Factor Status

Users with permission to manage other users can see and filter by two-factor authentication status:

- The user list includes a **Two-factor enabled** filter with options for both enabled and disabled
- Individual user detail pages show whether two-factor authentication is active
- The last login indicator shows whether the sign-in required two-factor verification

This helps administrators identify which users have enabled two-factor authentication and follow up with users who have not yet adopted it.
