## Overview

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented using Fortify two-factor routes for both Admin and Hub guards.

## User Flow

1. User enables two-factor authentication in account security.
2. User confirms setup and stores recovery codes.
3. Login requires two-factor challenge when enabled.

## Supported Endpoints

For authenticated users (after password confirmation):

- Enable 2FA
- Confirm 2FA setup
- Disable 2FA
- Retrieve QR code
- Retrieve secret key
- List/regenerate recovery codes

For guests during login:

- Two-factor challenge page
- Two-factor challenge submission (throttled)

## Operational Guidance

- Encourage admins to store recovery codes securely.
- Require password confirmation before changing 2FA settings.
- Monitor account lockout/support process for lost authenticators.
