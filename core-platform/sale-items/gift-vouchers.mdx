## Overview

- Gift vouchers are a company-level sale item that carries a monetary value. When redeemed, the full voucher amount is credited to the customer's [account balance](/core-platform/account-balances/top-ups).
- Gift vouchers are not tied to a specific event — they are managed at the company level and appear on a dedicated browse page in the shop.
- Pricing can be **fixed** (set denominations) or **variable** (customer chooses the amount). Gift vouchers cannot be free.
- Each purchased voucher receives a unique code that can be shared with a recipient and redeemed once.
- Gift vouchers have unlimited stock by default.
- The gift vouchers feature must be enabled on your company.

<Warning>
  Balance spending in the shop must also be enabled for customers to use their
  redeemed voucher balance at checkout. A warning is shown in the admin if this
  setting is disabled.
</Warning>

## Use Cases

<Accordion title="Gifting experiences">
  Customers purchase a gift voucher and share the code with a friend or family
  member. The recipient redeems the code to their account and uses the balance
  to book any event or purchase any item on the platform.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Promotional credit">
  An organiser creates fixed-denomination gift vouchers (e.g. £10, £25, £50) to
  sell as part of a promotion or partnership. Purchasers receive a downloadable
  PDF with a QR code they can print or forward.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Checkout upsell">
  With the upsell message enabled, customers browsing sale items see a prompt to
  buy a gift voucher. This drives additional revenue from customers who may want
  to share an experience with others.
</Accordion>

## Purchasing Gift Vouchers

### Browse Page

Gift vouchers are displayed on a dedicated browse page at `/gift-vouchers`. This page can be customised with:

- A **title** and **description** to introduce the voucher offering.
- A **header image** displayed at the top of the page.

When no gift vouchers are available, the page shows _"No gift vouchers are currently available for purchase"_.

### Adding to Basket

Each gift voucher is displayed as a card showing its name, image, and price. For variable-priced vouchers, the customer enters their desired amount before adding to the basket. The voucher is then purchased through the standard checkout flow.

### What the Customer Receives

After purchase, the customer receives:

- A **unique voucher code** (generated automatically).
- A **downloadable PDF** with a QR code that links directly to the redemption page.
- The PDF can include fields for **To**, **From**, and **Note** — allowing it to be printed or forwarded as a gift.

## Redeeming Gift Vouchers

Customers redeem gift vouchers from their account via the **Redeem gift voucher** option in the user menu.

### Redemption Flow

1. The customer enters the voucher code.
2. The system displays the voucher amount and the customer's current account balance.
3. The customer confirms the redemption.
4. The full voucher amount is added to their account balance.

<Note>
  Once redeemed, the full balance associated with the voucher is assigned to the
  customer's account. The voucher cannot be reused or split between accounts.
</Note>

### Redemption Constraints

- A voucher can only be redeemed **once**. Attempting to redeem a claimed voucher will fail.
- The voucher must be in the **same currency** as the customer's account balance. A warning is displayed if the currencies do not match.
- **Guest users** cannot redeem vouchers — they must upgrade to a full account first.
- **Cancelled or rejected** vouchers cannot be redeemed.
- Vouchers with **pending transfers** cannot be redeemed until the transfer is resolved.

## Spending the Balance

Redeemed voucher amounts are credited to the customer's [account balance](/core-platform/account-balances/top-ups) (wallet). This balance can then be used as a payment method at checkout:

- The balance can cover the **full order amount** or be used as a **partial payment** alongside another payment method (e.g. card) via [split payments](/core-platform/payments/split-payments).
- Account balance **cannot** be used to purchase additional gift vouchers or [wallet topups](/core-platform/account-balances/top-ups).

## Configuration

### Per-Voucher Settings

Each gift voucher sale item can be configured with:

- **Pricing** — fixed denominations or variable (customer-chosen) amounts. Variable pricing does not require minimum or maximum bounds.
- **[On-sale dates](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts#on-sale-dates)** — when the voucher is available for purchase.
- **[Sales channels](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts#sales-channels)** — where the voucher can be purchased (shop, box office, kiosk).
- **[Visibility settings](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts#visibility--display)** — hide when off sale, custom sale badges.
- **Name suffix** — append a label to the voucher name in the shop.
- **Printable template** — assign a [custom PDF](/core-platform/event-management/event-media/custom-pdfs) design for the downloadable voucher. A default template can be set at the company level.
- **Discounts** — optionally allow [discount codes](/core-platform/basket-codes/discount-codes) to apply to the voucher.

### Fees

Gift voucher fees can be configured separately from other item types:

- **Fixed fee** — a flat amount added to the voucher price.
- **Percentage fee** — a percentage of the voucher price.
- **Minimum / maximum fee** — bounds on the calculated fee amount.

## Box Office

[Box office](/core-platform/box-office/introduction) staff can redeem gift vouchers on behalf of customers. A customer must be selected before redemption — the voucher balance is credited to the selected customer's account, not the box office operator's.

## Refunds

- Gift vouchers that have **not been redeemed** can be refunded through the standard refund process.
- Gift vouchers that have **already been redeemed** (claimed to a wallet) cannot be refunded.
- Orders containing gift vouchers [cannot be modified](/core-platform/order-management/order-modifications).

## Reporting

A **Gift voucher redemption report** is available to track purchased vouchers and their claim status — showing which vouchers have been redeemed and which remain unclaimed.
