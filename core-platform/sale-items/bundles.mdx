description: "Group multiple items together so they are purchased as a single unit."

## Overview

- Bundles allow you to group multiple items together so that when a customer purchases the lead item, all included items are automatically added to their basket.
- Included items are part of the lead item's price — customers pay the lead item's price and receive the included items at no additional cost.
- Tickets, products, season tickets, and the dedicated **bundle** item type can all include other items.
- Items that can be included are: tickets, products, guest lists, and [wallet topups](/core-platform/account-balances/top-ups).
- The bundles feature must be enabled on your company to use this functionality.

<Note>
Orders that contain items with included items cannot be moved within a schedule using the "Move dates" functionality.
</Note>

## Use Cases

<Accordion title="Family tickets">
  A venue creates a "Family Ticket" that includes 2 adult tickets and 2 child tickets. Customers purchase a single item at a set price and receive all four tickets automatically.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="VIP packages">
  An event offers a VIP package that bundles a premium ticket with a merchandise product and a wallet topup for on-site spending. The bundle is priced as a single item, and each component is delivered to the customer individually.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Season ticket with welcome pack">
  A season ticket includes a welcome product (e.g. a scarf or programme) automatically. The customer sees one item and price, and receives both the season pass and the product.
</Accordion>

## The Bundle Item Type

The platform provides a dedicated **bundle** item type that acts purely as a container for other items. This is useful when the bundle itself is the product — rather than one specific ticket or product being the lead item.

The bundle type supports:
- [Timeslots](/core-platform/event-management/timeslots) and [sale item groups](/core-platform/event-management/sale-item-groups)
- [Price bands](/core-platform/event-management/seated-events) (for seated events)
- [Stock management](/core-platform/sale-items/stock-management), [order limits](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts#order-limits), and [sales channels](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts#sales-channels)
- [Add-ons](/core-platform/sale-items/add-ons)
- [Approval requirements](/core-platform/sale-items/item-approvals)
- [On-sale dates](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts#on-sale-dates) and [visibility settings](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts#visibility--display)

Bundles are created from the event dashboard under the **Bundles** section.

## Including Items

### Adding Items to a Bundle

The **Included items** card appears on any ticket, product, season ticket, or bundle that is not itself already included in another bundle. From this card you can:

- Select existing items from the same event to include.
- Specify a **quantity** for each included item (e.g. include 2 adult tickets and 2 child tickets).

<Warning>
If any included item is out of stock, the entire bundle becomes unavailable for purchase.
</Warning>

### What Can Be Included

| Item Type | Can Be Included |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Ticket** | Yes |
| **Product** | Yes |
| **Guest List** | Yes |
| **Wallet Topup** | Yes (can be from a different event) |
| **Bundle** | No — bundles cannot be nested |
| **Add-on** | No |
| **Donation** | No |
| **Gift Voucher** | No |
| **Fee** | No |

### Restrictions

Items cannot be included if they:
- Are already included in another bundle.
- Already have their own included items (no nesting).
- Have variable pricing (e.g. [donations](/core-platform/sale-items/donations)).
- Are [add-on](/core-platform/sale-items/add-ons) items.
- Are from a different event (except wallet topups, which can cross events).
- Have a different approval requirement to the lead item — all items in a bundle must either all require [approval](/core-platform/sale-items/item-approvals) or all not require it.

## Display Settings

### Hide Included Items

The **Hide included items** toggle controls how the bundle appears to customers:

- **Enabled** — only the bundle is displayed. The items contained within it are not shown.
- **Disabled** (default) — the bundle and all included items are visible. Customers can expand the bundle to see what is included.

When included items are visible, the event page shows an indicator such as *"Includes 2 other items"* beneath the lead item, with a *"View more details & included items"* link to expand the list.

### Cross-Promotion

Items that can also be purchased as part of a bundle display a link on the event page: *"Item is also part of a bundle"*. This helps customers discover the bundle option when browsing individual items.

## Customer Experience

### Event Page

Bundles appear as a single item on the event page with their own name, price, and image. If **Hide included items** is off, customers can expand the bundle to see the included items and their details.

### Basket

When a customer adds a bundle to their basket:

1. The lead item and all included items are added automatically.
2. The lead item displays a **"Bundle"** badge.
3. Included items are shown nested under the lead item (unless hidden by the collapse setting) and labelled *"Bundled with '[lead item name]'"*.
4. Included items cannot be removed individually — removing the lead item removes all included items.
5. Included item quantities cannot be changed independently in the basket.

## Key Behaviours

### Stock

Bundle stock is determined by the included items' available stock. The platform calculates how many complete bundles can be sold based on the most constrained item:

- If a bundle includes 2x Item A (3 in stock) and 1x Item B (5 in stock), then 1 bundle is available (limited by Item A: 3 stock / 2 per bundle = 1).
- When a bundle is purchased, stock is deducted from each included item individually.

### On-Sale Status

A bundle is only considered on sale if **all** of its included items are on sale. If any included item goes off sale, the entire bundle goes off sale.

### Visibility

- If the bundle or any included item has **hide when off sale** enabled, the bundle is hidden when any item is off sale.
- If the bundle or any included item has **hide when out of stock** enabled, the bundle is hidden when any item is out of stock.

### Cascading Removal

Removing a bundle from the basket automatically removes all of its included items. Stock for each item is restored.

### Basket Size

Only the lead item counts toward the basket size limit. Included items do not count separately.

## Pricing

- The lead item has its own configured price, which is the price the customer pays.
- Included items are covered by the lead item's price and display as free in the basket.
- Variable-priced items cannot be included in a bundle.

## Refunds

- Bundles must be refunded as a whole — individual included items cannot be refunded separately.
- When initiating a refund, selecting the lead item automatically includes all bundled items.
- Self-serve refunds for bundles are only available when all included items are tickets or season tickets.

## Resale

Bundles are ineligible for [primary resale](/core-platform/resale/configuration). Neither the lead item nor any included item can be listed for resale.

## Access Control

Each included item operates independently for [access control](/core-platform/event-management/access-control). Every item in the bundle receives its own barcode and can be scanned individually, allowing different items to grant access to different [zones](/core-platform/event-management/access-control#zones) or at different times.

## Event Copying

When [copying an event](/core-platform/event-management/copying-events), bundle relationships are preserved. All included items are copied alongside their lead item, and the bundling configuration is recreated on the new event.
