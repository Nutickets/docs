## Overview

- An add-on is a sale item that can only be purchased alongside a parent item. When a customer adds the parent item to their basket, its add-ons become available for selection during checkout.
- Only [tickets](/core-platform/sale-items/item-types) and [bundles](/core-platform/sale-items/bundles) can have add-ons.
- Add-ons can be either tickets or products.
- Each add-on has its own [pricing](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts#pricing), [stock](/core-platform/sale-items/stock-management), [on-sale dates](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts#on-sale-dates), and [sales channel](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts#sales-channels) settings, independent of the parent item.
- Add-ons cannot be nested — an add-on cannot have its own add-ons.

## Use Cases

<Accordion title="Parking passes">
  A venue offers parking passes that should only be available to ticket holders. By creating the parking pass as an add-on of the admission ticket, customers are prompted to add parking during checkout rather than having to find and purchase it separately.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Meal packages">
  A festival sells meal deals alongside day tickets. Each day ticket can have its own set of meal add-ons, allowing customers to pre-order food specific to the day they are attending.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Merchandise with admission">
  An event sells branded merchandise that should only be available to ticket buyers. Making the merchandise a product add-on of the ticket ensures it is only purchasable in combination with admission.
</Accordion>

## Creating Add-Ons

Add-ons are managed from the parent sale item's page in the admin dashboard. The **Add-ons** card appears on any ticket or bundle that is not itself an add-on.

From this card you can:
- **Assign an existing item** — select from tickets and products already in your inventory.
- **Create a new ticket** — create a new ticket directly as an add-on.
- **Create a new product** — create a new product directly as an add-on (requires the product sales feature to be enabled).

<Note>
Add-ons inherit the parent item's [timeslot](/core-platform/event-management/timeslots) assignment. All other settings — pricing, stock, on-sale dates, visibility — are configured independently on each add-on.
</Note>

## Customer Experience

### Event Page

Items with add-ons display an indicator on the event page: *"This item has add-ons available to purchase during checkout."* Add-ons are not shown directly on the event page — they appear on a dedicated selection screen after the parent item is added to the basket.

### Add-On Selection

After adding parent items to the basket, the customer is directed to the add-on selection page. This page:

1. Groups available add-ons by parent item, with each parent item numbered (e.g. **#1**, **#2**).
2. Displays add-ons in a grid with images and quantity selectors.
3. Shows a progress bar when add-ons span multiple events (e.g. via [global basket](/core-platform/ticket-shop/global-basket)).
4. Allows the customer to skip add-on selection entirely and proceed to checkout.

<Note>
Each instance of a parent item gets its own independent add-on selection. If a customer purchases three tickets, they can choose different add-ons for each ticket.
</Note>

### Basket

In the basket, add-on items display a **"Purchased with: [parent name]"** label linking them to their parent. Add-on quantities cannot be edited directly in the basket — an edit button redirects the customer back to the add-on selection page.

## Key Behaviours

### Cascading Removal

Removing a parent item from the basket automatically removes all of its add-ons. Stock for the removed add-ons is restored immediately.

### On-Sale Inheritance

If a parent item goes off sale, all of its add-ons are automatically treated as off sale, regardless of the add-ons' own on-sale dates. An add-on can also be individually off sale while its parent remains on sale.

### Forced Minimum Quantity

Add-ons cannot use the [forced minimum](/core-platform/sale-items/core-concepts#order-limits) order quantity setting. This ensures customers are never forced to purchase an add-on they did not explicitly select.

## Resale

Items involved in add-on relationships are ineligible for [primary resale](/core-platform/resale/configuration):

- A parent item that has add-ons purchased with it cannot be listed for resale.
- An add-on item itself cannot be listed for resale.

## Bundling

Add-on items cannot be included in [bundles](/core-platform/sale-items/bundles). Bundles and add-ons are mutually exclusive — an item can be one or the other, not both. However, a bundle itself can have add-ons attached to it.

## Box Office

In the [box office](/core-platform/box-office/introduction), staff can bypass the requirement that a parent item must be in the basket before purchasing an add-on. This allows box office operators to handle edge cases without being blocked by the standard validation.

## Event Copying

When [copying an event](/core-platform/event-management/copying-events), add-ons are automatically copied along with their parent items. The parent-child relationship is preserved on the new event.

## Access Control

Add-ons that support scanning (tickets and products) work with [access control](/core-platform/event-management/access-control) independently of their parent item. When using [precision scanning](/core-platform/access-control/admitting-via-app), scanning a ticket that has eligible add-ons prompts the operator to select the specific item being scanned, enabling accurate reporting on which item was admitted at what time.
