## Overview

Tracking is configured at two layers:

- **Company-level GTM/tag settings** (for shop/admin shell injection).
- **Event-level tracking settings** for supported pixel/event platforms.

Event-level tracking is feature-gated by `event_level_tracking_pixels`.

## Company-Level Tracking

Company settings can store Google Tag Manager codes used by shop/admin middleware/layout rendering.

This creates a shared baseline tracking layer across the storefront.

## Event-Level Tracking

Event tracking settings allow enabling platform-specific tracking codes and event mappings per event.

Supported platform configuration in the event tracking UI includes providers such as:

- X (Twitter)
- TikTok
- Spotify
- Meta

Per platform, admins can configure:

- Pixel/code ID
- Fallback/default event handling
- Event-type mappings with parameter hints

## Behaviour Notes

- If no platform is configured for an event, event tracking panel reports none enabled.
- Company GTM code can still exist even when event-level platform tracking is empty.
- Some checkout-level behaviours (for example global basket options) are constrained when event-level tracking features are active.

## Embedded Shop Tracking

The embed flow can inject optional iframe tracking support scripts alongside the embed script when enabled in embed setup.
