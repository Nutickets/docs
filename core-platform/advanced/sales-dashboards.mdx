## Overview

Sales dashboards provide high-speed operational visibility for:

- Company-level sales
- Single-event sales
- Event-schedule sales

These views are designed for rapid monitoring rather than formal reporting exports.

## Dashboard Surfaces

Admin controllers and routes provide dedicated pages for:

- Company sales dashboard
- Event sales dashboard
- Event schedule sales dashboard

Shared dashboard context includes company currencies and event item types to support consistent widget data across views.

## What Dashboards Show

Dashboard screens are widget-driven and include operational indicators such as:

- Sales and distribution trends
- Capacity breakdowns (sold/reserved/complimentary) where relevant
- Event lists and related quick-navigation actions

## Permissions

Access is permission-gated:

- Company dashboards require reporting-level visibility permission.
- Event/schedule dashboards require view access to those entities.

## Dashboard vs Reporting

Use dashboards for live monitoring and operational decisions.

Use reporting when you need:

- Exportable datasets
- Repeatable filter logic
- Scheduled distribution and publication
