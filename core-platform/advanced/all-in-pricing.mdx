title: "All-In Pricing"
description: "Show customers the complete price including all fees and taxes throughout the shop, eliminating surprises at checkout."

## Overview

All-in pricing shows customers the full price of an item — including applicable fees and taxes — everywhere in the shop. Instead of seeing a base price on the listing page and then discovering additional fees at checkout, customers see a single, transparent total from the moment they start browsing.

This is purely a presentation change. The underlying fee structure, base prices, and tax calculations remain exactly the same. Reporting, settlement, and reconciliation continue to use actual base prices and individual fee amounts. All-in pricing simply changes what number customers see as they shop.

## Prerequisites

Before you can enable all-in pricing, two conditions must be met:

1. **Feature flag** — The **Display Pricing** feature must be enabled for your account. Contact support if this feature is not available.
2. **Tax display setting** — Your account must be configured to display prices **including tax**. All-in pricing cannot be used when prices are displayed excluding tax.

<Note>
If you attempt to enable all-in pricing while prices are displayed excluding tax, you will see the message: "You cannot enable the all-in pricing feature when prices are displayed excluding tax." Similarly, if all-in pricing is already enabled, you cannot switch your tax display to exclude tax.
</Note>

## What Customers See

When all-in pricing is enabled, the displayed price throughout the shop reflects the total a customer will pay for the item, rather than just the base price. This applies across:

- **Browse and listing pages** — Items show their all-in price
- **Item detail pages** — The price shown includes all applicable fees
- **Basket** — Line items display all-in prices
- **Checkout** — Pricing remains transparent and consistent with what was shown earlier

The goal is consistency: the price a customer sees when first browsing an item is the same price they see all the way through to checkout. There are no hidden additions along the way.

<Note>
Fee items themselves (such as a booking fee line item in the basket) are not affected by all-in pricing. They continue to display their own individual price. All-in pricing only changes how the main item prices are presented.
</Note>

## What Is Included in the All-In Price

The all-in price always includes the item's base price plus any per-item fees. Beyond that, two additional fee types can optionally be folded into the displayed price, controlled by settings in the admin.

| Component | Included by default | Configurable |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| Base price | Always | No |
| Per-item fees | Always | No |
| Per-order fees | No | Yes — via **Include per-order fees** setting |
| Fulfilment fees | No | Yes — via **Include fulfilment fees** setting |

For resale items, resale fees are included in the all-in price minus any seller contributions.

## Configuring All-In Pricing Settings

To adjust which fees are included in the all-in price:

1. Navigate to **Pricing Settings** in the admin
2. Under **All-in pricing settings**, you will see the available options
3. Toggle the settings as needed
4. Click **Save**

### Include per-order fees

When enabled, fees that are applied once per order are distributed and included within each item's displayed price. This means the price shown on an item accounts for the per-order fee, so the total at checkout closely matches the sum of the displayed item prices.

When disabled (the default), per-order fees appear separately and are not part of the displayed item price.

### Include fulfilment fees

When enabled, the cheapest available fulfilment fee is included within an item's displayed price — but only when there is no download option available. If a free download fulfilment method exists, the fulfilment fee is not included in the all-in price since the customer could choose the free option.

When disabled (the default), fulfilment fees are not factored into the displayed item price.

<Note>
Changing these settings triggers a background recalculation of display prices for all items across your account. The admin shows this message when saving: "Changing these settings will require the system to recalculate display pricing for all items within your account. This will happen in the background once the settings have been saved. It may take a few minutes to see the changes reflected within the shop."
</Note>

## Background Recalculation

When you change all-in pricing settings, the system recalculates display prices for all future events in the background. This is automatic — you do not need to take any additional action.

A few things to be aware of:

- **It takes a few minutes** for updated prices to appear in the shop after saving new settings
- **Only future events** are recalculated. Existing orders are not affected by changes to all-in pricing settings
- **No recalculation is triggered** if you save the settings without actually changing any values

## Reporting and Settlement

All-in pricing does not affect your financial data. Behind the scenes, the original base prices and individual fee amounts are preserved and used for:

- **Reports** — All financial reports use actual base prices and fee breakdowns
- **Settlement** — Payouts are calculated from real fee and price data, not display prices
- **Reconciliation** — Line-item detail remains fully itemised

This means you can enable or adjust all-in pricing settings without concern about impacting your financial records or reporting accuracy.
