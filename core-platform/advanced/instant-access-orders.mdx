## Overview

Instant access orders allow invoice/manual-payment orders to complete checkout with immediate access to purchased items before payment is settled.

This is feature-gated and controlled by company manual-payment settings.

## Eligibility Requirements

An order is eligible only when all relevant conditions are met:

- Manual payments are enabled.
- Company has feature access to `instant_access_orders`.
- Company setting `manual_payments_instant_access_enabled` is enabled.
- Standard manual-payment eligibility checks pass.

Eligibility is evaluated by `ManualPaymentSettings::eligibleForInstantAccess()` and surfaced during checkout.

## Configuration

Configured via company payment settings (saved in `SaveCompanySettings`):

- `manual_payments_enabled`
- `manual_payments_instant_access_enabled`
- Pending-payment windows and related invoice settings

Validation rules enforce correct combinations, including pending-day limits based on instant-access state.

## Runtime Behaviour

When an eligible invoice is generated (`GenerateInvoiceForOrder`):

- `instant_access` is set on the invoice/order context.
- Pending expiry can be lifted for that instant-access path.

Customers get immediate access flow while the invoice remains payable.

## Operational Considerations

Use this only where invoice-credit risk is acceptable.

Recommended controls:

- Tight eligibility and approval policies for invoice payers.
- Clear payment instructions and due dates.
- Reporting/review process for overdue instant-access invoices.
