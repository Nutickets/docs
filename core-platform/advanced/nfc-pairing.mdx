description: "Pair order items to NFC tags for access-control scanning, with conflict handling and event-scope safeguards."

## Overview

NFC pairing links an order item/ticket to an NFC tag so access-control entry can be handled through NFC scans.

Pairing mode is configured at event level through scanning mode options.

## Scanning Modes

Event scanning modes include:

- `qr-only`
- `dynamic-qr-only`
- `pair-nfc-no-credits`
- `pair-nfc-with-credits` (legacy/disabled path retained for compatibility)

Available options are filtered by feature access and current event state.

## Pairing Flow

Pairing is handled by API/action logic (`PairTicket`, `OrderItem::pairWithNfcTag`), with checks for:

- Event/company scope validity.
- Duplicate request UUID handling.
- Existing pair conflicts for the same customer/event.
- Invalid barcode or already-paired states.

If the same NFC tag is paired across conflicting customers for the same event context, conflicting links are detached according to pairing rules.

## Data Surface

Paired NFC tag data is exposed in admin/shop payloads where relevant so downstream screens can render NFC-linked state.

## Operational Considerations

- Pairing should be done with clear event-day operational procedures.
- Re-pairing behaviour can affect existing links; train event teams before live use.
- Confirm scanning mode in each event before opening doors.
