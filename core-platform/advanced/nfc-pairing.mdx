title: "NFC Pairing"
description: "Link physical NFC wristbands or tags to tickets so attendees can tap for entry instead of scanning a QR code."

## Overview

NFC pairing links a physical NFC wristband or tag to a ticket, enabling contactless access control. Instead of showing a QR code at each scanning point, an attendee taps their NFC tag against a scanner to gain entry.

This is useful for:
- Festivals and multi-day events where wristbands replace phone-based scanning
- Venues with high-throughput entry points where tap-to-enter is faster than QR scanning
- Events where attendees may not have their phone readily available

All pairing happens on-site through the access control mobile app. Staff pair tags to tickets during check-in or at a dedicated NFC station.

## Setting the Scanning Mode

NFC pairing must be enabled at the event level before staff can pair tags.

1. Open the event in the admin panel
2. Set the scanning mode to **NFC (online)**

The available scanning modes are:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **QR Only** | Standard barcode scanning (default) |
| **Secure QR Only** | Dynamic secure barcodes that rotate periodically |
| **NFC (online)** | NFC-based access control, requires network connectivity |

<Note>
An **NFC (offline)** mode exists as a legacy option but is disabled for new configurations. Use **NFC (online)** for all NFC deployments.
</Note>

## Pairing an NFC Tag to a Ticket

Staff use the access control mobile app to link a physical tag to a ticket:

1. Open the access control app on the scanning device
2. Tap or scan the NFC tag
3. Scan the attendee's ticket barcode
4. The system links the NFC tag to that ticket

Once paired, the attendee can tap their NFC tag at any scanning point for that event instead of presenting a QR code.

<Note>
The access control app and a network connection are required for pairing. All pairing is done on-site by event staff — attendees cannot pair tags themselves through the web or customer account.
</Note>

## Re-pairing and Conflict Resolution

Staff can re-pair tags at any time. The system handles conflicts automatically:

| Scenario | What happens |
|----------|-------------|
| Pairing a **new tag** to a ticket that already has one | The old tag is replaced. The previous tag no longer works for that ticket. |
| Pairing a tag that is **already linked** to a different ticket at the same event | The existing link is detached, and the tag is paired to the new ticket. |
| Pairing a tag that is linked to a ticket at a **different event** | The other event's pairing is unaffected. Tags can be paired independently per event. |

<Note>
When a new tag replaces an existing one, the old tag is immediately invalidated for that ticket. Make sure the attendee understands their previous tag will no longer grant entry.
</Note>

## How Zone Scanning Works with NFC

When an attendee taps their NFC tag at a scanning point, the system resolves the correct ticket by:

1. Searching for tickets linked to that NFC tag ID
2. Filtering to tickets in completed orders (or orders with instant access enabled)
3. If multiple matches exist, narrowing to tickets for the specific event
4. Selecting the most recently updated pairing if multiple matches remain

This means a single NFC tag can be paired to tickets across different events without interference.

## NFC Tags in the Customer Account

If the **EPOS** feature is enabled, customers can manage their paired NFC tags through their account wallet:

- **View** their paired NFC tags
- **Name** a tag (e.g. "My Wristband" or "VIP Band") for easy identification
- **Freeze / Unfreeze** a tag to temporarily disable or re-enable it

<Note>
Customer-facing NFC management requires the EPOS feature to be enabled for the company. Without it, NFC pairing is purely an operational feature managed by staff through the access control app.
</Note>

## Viewing Pairing Status in Admin

NFC pairing status is visible on individual order items in the admin panel. When a ticket has a paired NFC tag, the pairing details appear alongside the barcode actions for that item.

## Operational Checklist

Before using NFC pairing at an event:

- Set the event scanning mode to **NFC (online)** before doors open
- Ensure all scanning devices have the access control app installed
- Confirm network connectivity is available at all scanning and pairing stations
- Brief staff on re-pairing behaviour — pairing a new tag invalidates the previous one for that ticket
- If customers will manage their own tags, verify the EPOS feature is enabled
