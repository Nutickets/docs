## Overview

Lead capture gives exhibitors at your events a simple way to collect attendee contact details. Each exhibitor scans attendee tickets using the access control app, and after the event, a CSV report of all scanned leads is automatically emailed to the exhibitor's contact.

This is useful for:
- Trade shows and expos where exhibitors need to collect visitor information
- Sponsored events where partners want to follow up with attendees
- Any event where third parties need a controlled way to capture attendee data

Behind the scenes, each exhibitor is a specially configured access control zone with its own user account, permissions, and automated report.

## Prerequisites

Lead capture requires two feature flags to be enabled:

| Feature Flag | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| **Access Control** | Provides the scanning infrastructure that exhibitors use |
| **Lead Capture** | Enables the exhibitor creation and management interface |

Both must be active before you can create exhibitors. Access control is the underlying technology — lead capture builds on top of it.

## Creating an Exhibitor

To set up a new exhibitor:

1. Navigate to the event and open **Exhibitors**
2. Click **Create exhibitor** (or **Add new exhibitor**)
3. Fill in the following fields:
   - **Exhibitor name** — the name displayed in the admin panel and in the access control app
   - **Contact name** — the person managing the exhibitor
   - **Contact email** — the email address that will receive login credentials and the automated lead report after the event

When you save, the system automatically:
- Creates (or locates) a user account for the contact email address
- Sends a password reset email so the contact can set their credentials
- Creates the exhibitor's scanning zone with lead-capture-specific settings
- Adds a **Notes** data capture field for the exhibitor to annotate scans
- Creates a scheduled **Lead Capture** report to be delivered after the event
- Assigns a restricted role so the contact can only access what they need

<Note>
If the contact email belongs to an existing user, that account is linked to the exhibitor rather than creating a duplicate. The user receives the restricted exhibitor role for this event.
</Note>

## What the Exhibitor Zone Does

Each exhibitor zone is automatically configured with settings optimised for lead collection:

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Fast scan | Enabled | Keeps the queue moving at busy stands |
| Scan limit | Once per attendee | Prevents duplicate leads |
| Direction | Entry only | No need to track exits |
| Accepted tickets | All event tickets | Any attendee can be scanned |
| Attendee list | Hidden | Exhibitors should not see the full attendee roster |

You do not need to configure these settings — they are applied automatically when the exhibitor is created.

## The Exhibitor Experience

Once an exhibitor is created, the contact goes through this workflow:

1. **Receives a password reset email** and sets their password
2. **Logs in** with their restricted account — they can only access the access control app for their assigned event
3. **Scans attendee tickets** at their stand using the access control app
4. **Adds notes** during scanning to record context about each lead (e.g. product interest, follow-up action)
5. **Receives the lead report** via email after the event ends

<Note>
Exhibitors do not have access to the admin panel. All scanning happens through the access control app. The admin interface is only for creating and managing exhibitors.
</Note>

## Managing Exhibitors

### Viewing Your Exhibitors

The **Exhibitors** page lists all exhibitors for the event, showing:
- Exhibitor name
- Contact details
- A live count of leads captured (scanned attendees)

Use the search bar to filter exhibitors by name.

### Editing an Exhibitor

You can update an exhibitor's name and contact details at any time.

<Note>
If you change the contact email, the previous contact loses access and the new contact receives a password reset email. The automated report delivery address also updates to the new contact email.
</Note>

### Deleting an Exhibitor

Deleting an exhibitor removes the exhibitor zone, the contact's access, the report, and the scheduled report delivery. Deleted exhibitors can be restored from the exhibitor list.

### Restoring an Exhibitor

When you restore a deleted exhibitor, the system reinstates the zone, contact access, and report. It also re-syncs the scheduled report delivery time, which is useful if event dates changed while the exhibitor was deleted.

## Automated Lead Report

Each exhibitor gets a scheduled report that delivers their captured leads automatically.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Report name | Lead Capture: \{exhibitor name\} |
| Format | CSV |
| Delivery | Emailed to the exhibitor's contact email |
| Schedule | One day after the event ends, at midnight in the event's timezone |

### Report Contents

The CSV includes one row per scanned attendee with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `scan_date` | When the attendee was scanned |
| `customer_name` | The attendee's name from their ticket |
| `customer_email` | The attendee's email from their ticket |
| `event_id` | The event identifier |
| `event_name` | The event name |
| `event_start_date` | When the event started |
| `data_capture_notes` | Any notes the exhibitor added during scanning |

Exhibitors can also view their report directly in the system without waiting for the scheduled email.
