## Overview

Lead capture is implemented through **Exhibitors** on events and is feature-gated by `lead_capture`.

When enabled, events can include exhibitor-specific access-control zones and scoped exhibitor users for scanning and lead collection workflows.

## Where It Appears

- Event access-control/settings areas expose Exhibitor options when the feature is enabled.
- Admin exhibitor views provide list/create/edit/delete flows per event.

## How Exhibitors Are Created

`SaveExhibitor` and related actions create and maintain:

- An exhibitor `EventZone` (`TYPE_EXHIBITOR`) with exhibitor-oriented defaults.
- A contact user (new or linked existing).
- A hidden role with restricted exhibitor permissions.
- Related report and scheduling settings via `SyncExhibitorSettings`.

Default zone behaviour includes settings such as single-scan style entry constraints and attendee visibility controls appropriate for lead workflows.

## Permissions and Access

Exhibitor access is intentionally scoped:

- Exhibitor users receive a constrained permission set through generated hidden roles.
- Access is tied to the exhibitor/company/event context.

## Reporting and Outputs

Lead-capture reporting is auto-provisioned for exhibitors, including scheduled output generation after event-end windows where configured.

## Operational Notes

- Treat exhibitor contact accounts as privileged access for event-day data collection.
- Review role/visibility scope when reusing existing users as exhibitor contacts.
- Confirm event-zone setup before event day to avoid scanning/visibility surprises.
