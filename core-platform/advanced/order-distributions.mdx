description: "Share selected quantities from an order so recipients can claim their own items using a distribution link/code."

## Overview

Order distributions let an order owner allocate selected items for others to claim.

This is commonly used for group purchases where one payer buys all items and distributes entitlements afterward.

## Eligibility

Distribution creation is blocked unless all checks pass (`SaveOrderDistribution`):

- Feature `order_distributions` is enabled.
- Source order is complete and not frozen.
- Actor owns the order.
- Selected items are distributable and have sufficient unclaimed quantity.

## Creation Rules

When creating/updating a distribution:

- Each distributed item group can have per-person claim limits.
- Claim limits cannot exceed total distributable quantity.
- Claimed groups cannot be removed in a way that invalidates existing claims.
- A distribution code is generated for claim journeys.

## Claim Rules

Claiming (`ClaimOrderDistributionItems`) enforces:

- Distribution must be active.
- Claimer must be authenticated and not the original owner.
- Feature access must still be valid.
- Claim quantity must respect per-person and remaining-quantity limits.

Claimed items are transferred to the claiming user. Distribution auto-disables when fully claimed.

## User Experience

- Owners manage distributions from account/order distribution forms.
- Recipients use claim links/pages and complete authenticated claim flow.
