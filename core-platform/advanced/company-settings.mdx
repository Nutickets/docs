## Overview

Company settings are the main control layer for platform behaviour. They are configured in:

- **Admin** for day-to-day operational settings (for example checkout, basket, pricing, manual payments, and integrations).
- **Partner Hub** for reseller-controlled settings, defaults, and higher-level company configuration.

Most setting updates are persisted through `SaveCompanySettings` (Admin) or `SaveCompany` (Hub), with validation and guardrails enforced in those actions.

## What Company Settings Control

Common advanced settings include:

- Basket and checkout behaviour (global basket, forced checkout, basket size/timeout, guest checkout).
- Pricing and tax display strategy.
- Manual/invoice payment behaviour.
- Event-level feature behaviour (where a feature is enabled for the company).
- Integration credentials and integration-specific operational options.
- Parent/child company sharing controls (`global_login`, `global_transactions`).

## Important Guardrails

The settings layer enforces compatibility rules. Examples include:

- Enabling **global basket** automatically disables forced checkout.
- **Global login** cannot be enabled when incompatible integrations are active (for example DTCM or Szamlazz checks in `SaveCompanySettings`).
- **Manual payment pending-day rules** change depending on whether instant access is enabled.
- Live/demo mode changes are tracked and can trigger alerts when switching a company with live sales.

## Company vs Reseller Ownership

Some settings are company-owned; others are inherited or constrained by reseller configuration:

- Reseller-level settings define available features, plans, currencies/languages/countries, and gateway/integration capabilities.
- Company-level settings choose from what the reseller has made available.

In practice, this means a company can only enable or configure options that are both:

1. Available for the reseller/plan.
2. Enabled for that company.

## Parent/Child Impact

When parent/child companies are configured:

- `global_login` controls whether customers can be resolved across related companies.
- `global_transactions` controls which company receives funds (`paymentCompany()` resolution).

These settings have broad effects on checkout identity, payments, and cross-company data visibility.

## Operational Recommendation

Treat company settings changes as production changes:

- Validate impacts on checkout, reporting, and integrations.
- Confirm role/permission scope for who can make changes.
- If changing payment-mode or shared-company controls, verify with a controlled end-to-end test order.
