## Overview

Single sign-on (SSO) allows customers to authenticate against an external identity provider instead of local username/password flows.

SSO is configured at company level in Partner Hub and used by shop auth controllers/actions.

## Supported SSO Types

Configured through company settings (`sso_type`) with built-in type definitions in `CompanySetting::ssoTypes()`:

- OpenID Connect
- Laravel Passport style integration
- External/custom
- Azure AD B2C

Each type has specific required fields (for example base URL, client ID/secret, policy, identifier mapping).

## Core Settings

Common SSO settings include:

- `sso_enabled`
- `sso_type`
- `sso_base_url`
- `sso_client_id` / `sso_client_secret`
- `sso_identifier_key`
- `sso_name`
- optional change-email / change-password / logout URLs

## Runtime Behaviour

When SSO is enabled:

- Shop auth flows route users through external-login logic.
- External identity attributes can be mapped into local user/provider records.
- Password-reset and auth UX behaviour changes to respect SSO ownership.

Logout handling can use provider-native logout support where available, with fallback to configured logout URL behaviour.

## Reporting and Data

SSO-linked identity values are available in several reporting contexts (for example customer/order/attendance report SSO identifiers), enabling reconciliation with external identity systems.
