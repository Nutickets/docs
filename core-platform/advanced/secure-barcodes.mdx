## Overview

Secure barcodes use rotating/dynamic barcode behaviour to reduce static barcode misuse.

The feature is tied to event scanning configuration and eligible item types.

## Eligibility Requirements

A sale item/order item can only use secure barcodes when required conditions are met, including:

- Event scanning mode supports dynamic/secure QR.
- Item type is eligible for secure barcode handling.
- Required secret/configuration values are present.

Eligibility logic is implemented across sale-item and order-item checks (`shouldHaveSecureBarcode`, `canHaveSecureBarcode`, related guards).

## Operational Controls

Admin can enable/disable secure barcodes for order items via secure-barcode controller endpoints.

Secure barcode seed generation is handled in batch for dynamic-QR events (`GenerateSecureBarcodeSeeds`).

## Download Behaviour

When secure barcode is active on an order item, PDF-download behaviour is restricted by order-item download guards (`canDownloadPdf`).

## Why Use It

Secure barcodes are most useful where:

- Screenshot/static-barcode sharing is a risk.
- Real-time scan validity is required.
- Event access should depend on freshest token state.
