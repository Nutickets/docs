## Overview

Internal questions are data capture questions visible only to staff — they never appear to customers during checkout or on any public-facing page. They are primarily used as **event codes**: structured data fields attached to events for operational tracking, internal references, or staff-entered metadata.

Internal questions are managed separately from standard data capture questions through their own interface at **Data Capture > Event codes**.

<Note>
Internal questions require the **Event codes** feature to be enabled for your company.

## How Internal Questions Differ

| Aspect | Standard Questions | Internal Questions |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Visible to customers** | Yes — shown during checkout and on forms | No — admin only |
| **Managed from** | Data capture questions library | Event codes tab |
| **Can be assigned to** | Events, items, tickets, registration, forms | Events, EPOS shops, EPOS products |
| **Responses linked to** | Customer and order | Source entity only (no user association) |
| **Multiple responses** | One per customer per field (marketing questions create a new record each time) | One per source entity, updated in place |

## Creating an Internal Question

1. Navigate to **Data Capture > Event codes**
2. Click **Create**
3. Complete the form:
   - **Question** — The label staff will see when entering data
   - **Question type** — The same [types](/core-platform/data-capture/managing-questions#question-types) available for standard questions (text, selection, date, etc.)
   - **Applies to** — The [assignment type](#assignment-types) that controls where the question appears
4. If the question type supports options, add the available choices
5. Click **Save**

When an internal question is created, it is automatically assigned to the selected entity type across all relevant entities.

## Assignment Types

Internal questions can be assigned to three entity types:

| Assignment | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Event** | The question appears on events. This is the most common use case — event codes, internal reference numbers, or operational metadata attached to each event. |
| **EPOS Shop** | The question appears on EPOS shop configurations. Only available when the **EPOS** feature is enabled. |
| **EPOS Product** | The question appears on individual EPOS product items. Only available when the **EPOS** feature is enabled. |

## Entering Responses

Internal question responses are entered directly on the entity they are assigned to. For event-assigned questions, staff view and complete responses from the event's management area.

Each internal question stores a single response per entity. When a value is updated, it replaces the previous answer rather than creating a new record — there is no response history for internal questions.

<Note>
Because internal questions are not linked to a specific user, they represent data about the entity itself (such as an event's internal tracking code) rather than information collected from a customer.
</Note>

## Managing Internal Questions

The **Event codes** page lists all internal questions for your company. From here you can:

- **Create** new internal questions
- **Edit** existing questions (text, type, options)
- **Delete** questions (soft-deleted, preserving historical responses)
- **Restore** previously deleted questions using the **Show deleted** toggle
