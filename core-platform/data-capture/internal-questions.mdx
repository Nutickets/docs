## Overview

- Internal questions are managed separately from standard external questions.
- They are powered by the internal-question feature set and often surfaced as event-code style data.
- Assignment type options control where and how these questions are used.

## Operational Notes

- Internal question management is feature-flag gated.
- Create/edit/delete/restore actions follow dedicated internal-question permissions.
