## Overview

- Data capture provides reusable question definitions for collecting customer and operational data.
- Questions can be assigned to multiple entities (events, forms, checkout contexts, and internal workflows).
- Responses are persisted per field/question and reused in reporting and downstream workflows.

## Core Components

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| Question | The reusable prompt and type definition |
| Options | Select/radio/multi-choice values |
| Field assignment | Placement of a question on a target entity/context |
| Response | Captured answer payload linked to user/order/context |
