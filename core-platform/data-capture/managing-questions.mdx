## Overview

The question library is where you create and manage reusable data capture questions. Each question defines what information to collect and how — the question text, the input type, optional validation rules, and any selectable options. Once created, a question can be [assigned](/core-platform/data-capture/assigning-questions) to appear across multiple events, items, or registration contexts.

Navigate to **Data Capture > Data capture questions** in the admin area to manage your question library.

## Creating a Question

To create a new question:

1. Navigate to **Data Capture > Data capture questions**
2. Click **Create**
3. Complete the question form:
   - **Question** — The text shown to customers (required)
   - **Question type** — Select from the [available types](#question-types) below (required)
   - **Category** — Optionally assign to a [category](#categories) for organisation
   - **Description** — Rich text content displayed below the question to provide customers with additional context or instructions
   - **Validation** — Optional rules to restrict what customers can enter (see [Validation Rules](#validation-rules))
4. If the selected question type supports options (Selection, Multiple Checkboxes, or Radio Buttons), add the available choices
5. Click **Save**

<Note>
Questions support multiple languages. If your platform uses translations, the question text and description can be provided in each configured language.
</Note>

## Question Types

Each question type determines the input format customers see and how answers are validated and stored. There are 14 types available, grouped into three categories.

### Text and Numeric Types

| Type | Input | When to Use |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Short Text** | Single-line text field | Names, reference numbers, brief answers |
| **Long Text** | Multi-line text area | Detailed responses, special requirements, notes |
| **Number** | Numeric input | Quantities, ages, numeric identifiers |
| **Email** | Email input with format validation | Collecting additional email addresses — validated against RFC and DNS standards |
| **Phone** | Phone input with country code selector | Collecting phone numbers with international format validation |

### Selection Types

| Type | Input | When to Use |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Selection** | Dropdown menu | Choose one option from a list — automatically switches to a searchable dropdown when more than four options are configured |
| **Radio Buttons** | Radio button group | Choose one option with all choices visible at once |
| **Checkbox** | Single checkbox | Consent acknowledgements, opt-ins, or single confirmations |
| **Multiple Checkboxes** | Checkbox group | Select one or more options from a list |
| **Yes / No** | Toggle control | Binary choice between yes and no |

### Date and Time Types

| Type | Input | When to Use |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Date** | Date picker | Single dates such as arrival date or date of birth |
| **Date & time** | Date and time picker | Precise moments such as flight arrival times |
| **Date range** | Two date pickers (start and end) | Periods such as accommodation dates |
| **Date & time range** | Two date and time pickers | Precise periods with specific start and end times |

### Marketing-Eligible Types

The following types can be used as marketing preference questions: **Checkbox**, **Yes / No**, **Date**, **Date & time**, **Date range**, and **Date & time range**.

Marketing questions behave differently from standard questions — each time a customer responds, a new record is created rather than updating the previous answer. This preserves a complete audit trail of preference changes over time, along with a snapshot of the marketing preference text that was displayed at the time of consent.

## Adding Options

For **Selection**, **Radio Buttons**, and **Multiple Checkboxes** question types, you define the options customers can choose from.

Each option has:

- **Value** — The text displayed to customers (required)
- **Description** — Optional additional context for the option

Options can be reordered by dragging. Deleted options are soft-deleted, preserving any existing responses that reference them.

<Note>
If duplicate options are detected (same value and description), the system automatically merges them into a single option and reassigns all existing responses to the merged record.
</Note>

## Validation Rules

Beyond the built-in validation each question type provides (such as email format checking for Email questions or numeric-only input for Number questions), you can add custom validation rules to further constrain answers:

| Rule | Format | Effect |
|------|--------|--------|
| Minimum length or value | `min:N` | Sets a minimum character count for text fields or minimum value for numbers and dates |
| Maximum length or value | `max:N` | Sets a maximum character count for text fields or maximum value for numbers and dates |
| Date format | `date_format:FORMAT` | Requires answers to match a specific date format |
| Before date | `before_or_equal:DATE` | Answer must be on or before the specified date |
| After date | `after_or_equal:DATE` | Answer must be on or after the specified date |
| Required | `required` | Field must be completed — this can also be controlled via field assignment settings when [assigning the question](/core-platform/data-capture/assigning-questions#field-settings) |

Multiple rules are combined with a pipe character. For example, `min:2|max:100` requires between 2 and 100 characters.

## Categories

Categories help organise your question library as it grows. They act purely as filters — when viewing or assigning questions, you can filter by category to quickly find what you need.

To manage categories:

1. Navigate to **Data Capture > Categories**
2. Create, edit, or delete categories as needed

Categories have no effect on where or how questions are displayed to customers. They are an organisational tool for administrators only.

## External Identifiers

Questions can be given an **External ID** for integration with external systems. This identifier must be unique within your company and can be used when referencing questions through the API or during data imports.

## Protected Fields

Questions can be marked as **protected**, which prevents their configuration from being modified after creation. Protected questions cannot have their type, text, or validation rules changed. This is typically used for system-generated questions or fields that external integrations depend on.

## Editing Questions

Click any question in the list to edit its text, type, options, or validation rules. Changes affect how the question appears going forward — existing responses retain the answer that was originally given.

<Warning>
If a question already has responses, changing its type may cause stored answers to no longer align with the new input format. Consider creating a new question instead of changing the type of one that has existing responses.
</Warning>

## Deleting and Restoring Questions

Deleting a question soft-deletes it along with all its field assignments. The question and its historical responses are preserved for reference but the question no longer appears to customers.

To view or restore deleted questions:

1. Navigate to **Data Capture > Data capture questions**
2. Enable the **Show deleted** toggle
3. Click **Restore** on any question you want to bring back

Restoring a question makes it available again in the library, but you will need to reassign it to the contexts where it should appear.
